I have copied my proposals over to the SymPy Wiki and formatted them so
that they look nice (including LaTeX for the formulas).  I included both
the Portland State University proposal, which was accepted (at the top),
and the Python Software Foundation proposal, which was nearly identical,
but was not accepted.  I did this mainly for myself so I can easily find
my timeline during the summer, but if anyone wants to see what my
proposal looked like, here it is.  Note that I am pretty sure that the
timeline on the proposal will not be the same as what I will actually do
(e.g., I have learned much less about systems of ODEs (0), than I
expected, and I have learned about a couple new symbolic methods).
