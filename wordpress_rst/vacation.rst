I am on vacation now. I am visiting the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam,
Yellowstone, and other places. I will be able to do some coding on the
road, but not as much as when I am home. The vacation will last about a
week. Hopefully I will be able to get a blog post about what I have been
doing in SymPy written up in the next few days.
