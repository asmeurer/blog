        <div><p></p><p>So from Sat­ur­day to Wednes­day of this week, I was on va­ca­tion to the Grand Canyon with­out my com­put­er.  There­fore, I did not do a whole lot with re­spect to SymPy this week.  The va­ca­tion was very fun, though.  My fam­i­ly and I hiked to the bot­tom of the Grand Canyon and stayed a day at the bot­tom in a lodge at Phan­tom Ranch, then hiked back up.  I would high­ly rec­om­mend it to any­one who does not mind do­ing a lit­tle hik­ing.   </p> 
 <p>Re­gard­ing what I did do, oth­er than catch­ing up on the email from when I was gone, I did some more work fin­ish­ing patch­es for the re­lease.  We are now  <em>very</em>  close to hav­ing a re­lease.  All the re­main­ing  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list?q=label:Milestone-Release0.7.0">block­ing is­sues</a>  ei­ther have patch­es that need to be re­viewed, or de­ci­sions that need to be made.</p> 
 <p>I al­so did some work on the Risch Al­go­rith­m, though it was­n't very much.  One of my fa­vorite ways to "do work" on the code is to stress test  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>  and if I find a bug or find that it runs too slow, see what needs to be done to fix it.  This week, I dis­cov­ered that  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>  has a bit of non­de­ter­min­ism built in­to it.  Ac­tu­al­ly, I al­ready knew this, but I re­cent­ly found an ex­am­ple that demon­strates it very nice­ly.  The prob­lem is that when it builds the ex­ten­sion to in­te­grate the func­tion,  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>  us­es  <code>.atom­s()</code>  to get the parts of the ex­pres­sion (for ex­am­ple,  <code>ex­pr.atom­s(log)</code>  gets all the log­a­rithms in  <code>ex­pr</code>).  But  <code>.atom­s()</code>  re­turns a set (I be­lieve this is for per­for­mance rea­son­s, though I'm not cer­tain).  So we get things like</p> 
 <p><strong>Hov­er over the code and click on the left­-­most, "view source" icon (a pa­per icon with  <tt>&lt; &gt;</tt>  over it) to view with­out break­s.  Opens in a new win­dow.</strong></p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>In [1]: a = Ad­d(<em>(log(x</em>*i) for i in range(10)))</p> 
 <p>In [2]: a</p> 
 <p>Out­[2]: 
            ⎛ 2⎞      ⎛ 3⎞      ⎛ 4⎞      ⎛ 5⎞      ⎛ 6⎞      ⎛ 7⎞      ⎛ 8⎞      ⎛ 9⎞
log(x) + log⎝x ⎠ + log⎝x ⎠ + log⎝x ⎠ + log⎝x ⎠ + log⎝x ⎠ + log⎝x ⎠ + log⎝x ⎠ + log⎝x ⎠</p> 
 <p>In [3]: b = risch_in­te­grate(a, x)</p> 
 <p>In [4]: b</p> 
 <p>Out­[4]: 
                ⎛ 4⎞
        45⋅x⋅log⎝x ⎠
-45⋅x + ────────────
             4     <br> 
[/­code]</p> 
 <p>This is cor­rec­t, since we have</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>In [5]: ex­pand(b.d­if­f(x) - a)</p> 
 <p>Out­[5]: 0</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p> 
 <p>(re­mem­ber that $la­tex \log{(x^n)}=n\log{(x)}$).  The in­te­gral can be ex­pressed in terms of any of the log­a­rithms in the ex­pres­sion.  It hap­pens to be ex­pressed in terms of $la­tex \log{(x^4)}$ be­cause that hap­pened to be the first one that came out of  <code>a.atom­s(log)</code>  dur­ing it­er­a­tion.  This is prob­lem­at­ic.  First, it's not ex­act­ly what is ex­pect­ed.  The ide­al so­lu­tion would be if the an­swer was writ­ten in terms of $la­tex \log{(x)}$.   </p> 
 <p>But it's ac­tu­al­ly worse than that.  Like I men­tioned, this is non­de­ter­min­is­tic.  It de­pends on the or­der of it­er­a­tion through a set, which is not guar­an­teed to be in any par­tic­u­lar or­der.  In­deed, if I run the fol­low­ing in 32-bit Python 2.7 and again in 64-bit Python 2.7), the out­put is ex­act­ly the same ex­cept for  <code>i</code>  = 64 to  <code>i</code>  = 77.</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>for i in range(100):
    print risch_in­te­grate(Ad­d(<em>(log(x</em>*j) for j in range(i))), x)
[/­code]</p> 
 <p>The ac­tu­al out­put seems to fol­low a pat­tern, though it's had to dis­cern ex­act­ly what it is.  The out­put for 32-bit is  <a href="https://gist.github.com/1008685" title="32-bit Python risch_integrate(logarithms)" target="_blank">http­s://gist.github.­com/1008685</a>  and the out­put for 64-bit is  <a href="https://gist.github.com/1008684" title="64-bit Python risch_integrate(logarithms)" target="_blank">http­s://gist.github.­com/1008684</a>  (sor­ry, I for­got to print  <code>i</code>; just sub­tract 4 from the line num­ber).   </p> 
 <p>So this has got­ten me think­ing about how to re­duce non­de­ter­min­is­m.  Clear­ly, I need to sort the re­sult of  <code>.atom­s()</code>, or else  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>  might re­turn a dif­fer­ent (though equiv­a­len­t) re­sult on dif­fer­ent plat­form­s. Ac­tu­al­ly, I've seen  <code>list(set)</code>  re­turn a dif­fer­ent re­sult in the  <em>same</em>  Python ses­sion.  That means that you could po­ten­tial­ly get some­thing like  <code>risch_in­te­grate(­ex­pr, x) == risch_in­te­grate(­ex­pr, x) =&gt; False</code>!</p> 
 <p>The prob­lem is how to sort the atom­s.  We re­cent­ly added a  <code>sort_key()</code>  func­tion that can be passed as a key to  <code>sort­ed()</code>, which is com­plete­ly de­ter­min­is­tic and plat­form in­de­pen­den­t.  That would solve the de­ter­min­ism prob­lem, but ac­tu­al­ly, I think this re­quires more thought.  The or­der that the dif­fer­en­tial ex­ten­sion is built in can af­fect not on­ly the form of the re­sult­ing anti­deriv­a­tive (though it will al­ways be equiv­a­len­t, up to a con­stan­t), but al­so the speed with which it is com­put­ed.  To take an ex­am­ple from  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=2010#c1">is­sue 2010</a>, the is­sue about  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>  (y­ou may al­so  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/prototype-risch_integrate-function-ready-for-testing/">rec­og­nize</a>  this ex­am­ple if you are a reg­u­lar read­er of this blog), the  <code>han­dle_­first</code>  key­word ar­gu­ment to  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>  af­fects if it builds the ex­ten­sion tow­er look­ing for log­a­rithms first or ex­po­nen­tials first.  Which­ever comes last is what is in­te­grat­ed first (the tow­er is in­te­grat­ed from the top to the bot­tom).  If the last ex­ten­sion was an ex­po­nen­tial, then it us­es the ex­po­nen­tial al­go­rith­m.  If it was a log­a­rith­m, then it us­es the log­a­rithm al­go­rith­m.  These are com­plete­ly dif­fer­ent al­go­rithm­s, and in­deed the re­sults can ap­pear in dif­fer­ent forms (and some­times, one will raise NotIm­ple­ment­ed­Er­ror while the oth­er will work be­cause I have im­ple­ment­ed the ex­po­nen­tial al­go­rithm more com­plete­ly than the log­a­rith­mic one).  It al­so af­fects the speed be­cause the in­te­grand might be of a dif­fer­ent "type" in the dif­fer­ent ex­ten­sion­s.  In the ex­am­ple be­low, the an­swers are dif­fer­ent be­cause it tries to make the ar­gu­ment of the log­a­rith­mic part mon­ic with re­spect to the ex­po­nen­tial or the log­a­rith­m, re­spec­tive­ly. Al­so no­tice the speed dif­fer­ence.  This can be ex­as­per­at­ed more for in­te­grands of dif­fer­ent forms than this one.</p>

 <p>So what I think I re­al­ly need to do is to do some re­search on what or­der of build­ing the tow­er makes it the most ef­fi­cien­t.  Al­so,  <code>han­dle_­first</code>  needs to be mod­i­fied to be more dy­nam­ic than just look­ing at ex­po­nen­tials or log­a­rithms first, but al­so con­sid­er­ing which ex­po­nen­tials or log­a­rithms to look at first, and the oth­ers might be rewrit­ten in terms of those (this need­ed to be done any­way to make it work for three types of ex­ten­sion­s: ex­po­nen­tial­s, log­a­rithm­s, and tan­gents).   </p> 
 <p>There can al­so be more heuris­tics for this.  Cur­rent­ly, there are heuris­tics for ex­po­nen­tials to pre­fer rewrit­ing $la­tex e^{2x}$ as $la­tex \left­({e^{x}}\right)^2$ in­stead of rewrit­ing $la­tex e^{x}$ as $la­tex \sqrt{e^{2x}}$ (this is nec­es­sary not on­ly for keep­ing things in terms of the nicer look­ing gcds but al­so be­cause  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>  does­n't know how to han­dle al­ge­bra­ic ex­ten­sions like square root­s). I did­n't re­al­ize it at the time, but the corol­lary heuris­tic for log­a­rithms should try to re­write $la­tex \log{(x^2)}$ in terms of $la­tex \log{(x)}$ and not the oth­er way around.  We can use the ex­act same gcd al­go­rithm (called  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/blob/integration3/sympy/integrals/risch.py#L44"><code>in­te­ger_pow­er­s()</code></a>  in  <code>risch.py</code>, and I now re­al­ize that it should ac­tu­al­ly be called  <code>in­te­ger_­mul­ti­ples()</code>) as we do for the ex­po­nen­tial, on­ly use the pow­ers of the ar­gu­ments in­stead of co­ef­fi­cients.  This might re­quire some fac­tor­iza­tion to do com­plete­ly cor­rect­ly, so it cer­tain­ly re­quires some thought.   </p>

 <p>I dis­cov­ered that there's an eas­i­er way to show the non­de­ter­min­ism of the above than run­ning it on dif­fer­ent ar­chi­tec­tures.  You just have to change the vari­able of in­te­gra­tion:</p>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>So the Google Sum­mer of Code cod­ing pe­ri­od of­fi­cial­ly start­ed on Mon­day, and in sol­i­dar­i­ty with the stu­dents, I will be blog­ging once a week about var­i­ous things.  Some of the posts will just be about what I have done that week.  Oth­ers will be con­tin­u­a­tions of my Risch Al­go­rithm se­ries of blog posts (see parts  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/integration-of-rational-functions/" target="_blank">0</a>,  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/the-risch-algorithm-part-1/" target="_blank">1</a>,  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/07/24/the-risch-algorithm-part-2-elementary-functions/" target="_blank">2</a>, and  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/08/14/the-risch-algorithm-part-3-liouvilles-theorem/" target="_blank">3</a>).   </p> 
 <p>This week, I will do the for­mer.  I have spend the past sev­er­al weeks pre­par­ing for the re­lease.  The main thing right now is to clear out  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=Milestone%3DRelease0.7.0+&amp;colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary+Stars&amp;cells=tiles" target="_blank">the is­sues that are block­ing the re­lease</a>.  I merged in a branch that in­clud­ed all of my polys re­lat­ed fix­es from my in­te­gra­tion3 branch. Along with sim­i­lar branch from ear­li­er that had some non-polys re­lat­ed fix­es (like some fix­es to the in­te­gral­s), all of my fix­es from in­te­gra­tion3 not di­rect­ly re­lat­ed to my im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Risch Al­go­rithm should no be in mas­ter.  </p> 
 <p>Once those is­sues are fixed, I should be ready to make a re­lease can­di­date for the re­lease.  The last re­lease was over a year ago (March 2010), and we've racked up  <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes-for-0.7.0" target="_blank">quite a few changes</a>  since then.  A few big ones are:</p> 
 <p></p><ul>
    <li>   <strong>The new polys</strong>.  This is (in my opin­ion) the big­gest change.  Be­cause of the new polys, ev­ery­thing is faster, and sim­pli­fi­ca­tion is far more pow­er­ful than it was be­fore.  This is for a few rea­son­s.  The big­gest rea­son is that the new polys al­low poly­no­mi­als in any kind of ex­pres­sion, not just Sym­bol­s.  This means that you can do things like fac­tor the ex­pres­sion $la­tex \cos^2{x} + 2\­cos{x} + 1$.  As you can imag­ine, many sim­pli­fi­ca­tions of com­plex ex­pres­sions are noth­ing more than poly­no­mi­al sim­pli­fi­ca­tion­s, where the poly­no­mi­al is in some func­tion.  
 <p>In ad­di­­tion to this, the new polys have a much faster im­­ple­­men­­ta­­tion, and if you have gmpy in­­stalled, it will use that and be even faster.  There are al­­so sev­er­al faster al­­go­rith­m­s, like a faster al­­go­rithm for mul­ti­­var­i­ate fac­­tor­iza­­­tion, that have been im­­ple­­men­t­ed. These all lead to blaz­ing fast sim­­pli­­fi­­ca­­tion and poly­no­mi­al minip­u­la­­tion in SymPy.</p></li> 
 <div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>The Quantum Module<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.  Unfortunatly, I can't say much about this, since I don't know anything about quantum physics.  Furthermore, at the time of the writing of this blog post, that part of the release notes hasn't been written yet.  Suffice it say that thanks to two GSoC projects from last summer (see <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/SymbolicQMReport"</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">"_blank"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>this<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> and <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Quantum_Computation_Report"</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">"_blank"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>this<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> page), we now have a quantum physics module.  A lot of the stuff in that module, from my understanding, is unique to SymPy, which is very exciting.  (By the way, if you're interested in this, Brian Granger can tell you more about it).<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>Various backwards incompatible changes<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.  We've taken advantage of the fact that this will be a point release (0.7.0) to clean up some old cruft.
</pre></div>


<p></p><ul>
    <li>We've re­named the func­tions  <code>ab­s()</code>  and  <code>sum()</code>  to  <code>Ab­s()</code>  and  <code>sum­ma­tion()</code>, re­spec­tive­ly, be­cause they con­flict­ed with built-in names (although thanks to  <code><strong>abs</strong></code>  mag­ic,  <code>ab­s(­ex­pr)</code>  will still work with the built-in  <code>ab­s()</code>  func­tion).   </li> 
 <div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>This will be the last release to support Python 2.4.  This will be a big benefit to not have to support Python 2.4 anymore after this release.  There were <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.5.html"</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">"_blank"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>a ton of features<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> added in Python 2.5 that we have had to either manually re-implement (like any() and all()), or have had to do without (like the with statement).    Also, this will make porting to Python 3 much easier (this is one of our GSoC projects).  <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>



<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>We split the class Basic, which is the base class of all SymPy types, into Basic and a subclass Expr.  Mathematical objects like <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>cos(x)<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> or <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>x*y*z**2<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> are instances of Expr.  Objects that do not make sense in mathematical expressions, but still want to have some of the standard SymPy methods like .args and .subs() are Basic.  For example, a Set object is Basic, but not Expr.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>



<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>Lots of little bug fixes and new features<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.  See the <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes-for-0.7.0"</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">"_blank"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>release notes<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


</ul>

<p>Once we have the re­lease out, I plan to go back to work on the Risch Al­go­rith­m.  I am very close to fin­ish­ing the ex­po­nen­tial case, which means that once I do, any tran­scen­den­tal el­e­men­tary func­tion built up of on­ly ex­po­nen­tial ex­ten­sions could be in­te­grat­ed or proven not to have an el­e­men­tary in­te­gral by my al­go­rith­m.  I al­so want to start get­ting the code ready to merge with the main code base, so that it can go in the next re­lease (0.7.1).   </p> 
 <p>Fi­nal­ly, I want to an­nounce that I have been se­lect­ed for a  <a href="http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2011/student.php" target="_blank">stu­dent spon­sor­ship</a>  to the SciPy 2011 con­fer­ence in Austin, TX in the week of Ju­ly 11. Ma­teusz and I will be pre­sent­ing a tu­to­ri­al on SymPy.  This will be the first time I have ev­er at­tend­ed a con­fer­ence, and I am very ex­cit­ed.   </p></ul></div>

        <hr>
        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>So now that Google has  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/accepted-gsoc-students-announced/">an­nounced the re­sults</a>  of Google Sum­mer of Code, I want to write down some gen­er­al things that I no­ticed when re­view­ing ap­pli­ca­tions while they are still fresh in my mind.   </p> 
 <p>Note that none of these things ap­ply to any spe­cif­ic stu­dent who ap­plied to SymPy.  Many of these things are things that I no­ticed that peo­ple did right.   </p> 
 <p>Most of this should ap­ply to any or­ga­ni­za­tion, though some of them might be SymPy speci­fic, since that is the lens that I am view­ing this through.  These aren't re­al­ly in any par­tic­u­lar or­der.   </p> 
 <p></p><ol>
    <li><strong>Ful­fill all the re­quire­ments.</strong>  This is kind of a no brain­er, and as it turns out, al­most all stu­dents who ap­plied to SymPy did in­deed do this.  For SymPy, this means that you should sub­mit a patch by the dead­line. Oth­er or­ga­ni­za­tions might have oth­er re­quire­ments.  If you don't ful­fill the re­quire­ments, it does­n't mat­ter how good your ap­pli­ca­tion is; you won't be el­i­gi­ble and hence won't be ac­cept­ed.</li> 
     <li><strong>Dis­cuss your pro­pos­al on the mail­ing list.</strong>  A pro­pos­al sub­mit­ted out of the blue has a poor chance of be­ing ac­cept­ed.  First, we like to see that you will be in­volved in the com­mu­ni­ty, and if you don't dis­cuss the pro­pos­al at al­l, it shows bad­ly.  Sec­ond, it is very like­ly that we will not like some­thing about your pro­pos­al, or will have ques­tions (see the next point).  If you don't dis­cuss it at al­l, you are mak­ing a shot in the dark.  Even if the pro­pos­al is good, it could be re­ject­ed sim­ply be­cause it's not some­thing that we feel that we wan­t. And you don't want to ac­ci­den­tal­ly sub­mit a pro­pos­al to do some­thing that has al­ready been im­ple­ment­ed.  
 <p>It's im­­por­­tant to dis­­­cuss it on the pub­­lic mail­ing list, not just with a spe­­cif­ic men­­tor.  Even if that men­­tor is the ex­pert on your project sub­­­ject and would like­­ly be the per­­son to men­­tor you if you are ac­­cep­t­ed, you need to re­mem­ber that all the men­­tors re­view the pro­­pos­als and de­­cide who to ac­­cep­t.   Al­­so, this year for SymPy, we are try­ing to put an em­pha­­sis on stu­­dents do­ing things pub­­licly with the whole com­­mu­ni­­ty, in­­stead of just with their men­­tors.</p></li> 
     <li><strong>Ask the men­tors for ad­vice on your pro­pos­al, and then fol­low it.</strong>  Again, most stu­dents who ap­plied to SymPy were good on this one too.  We re­quest that all stu­dents put their pro­pos­als on the GitHub wik­i, so that the men­tors can take a look at them and give ad­vice.  If you feel un­com­fort­able putting your ap­pli­ca­tion in a pub­lic place, send it to some men­tors pri­vate­ly.  
 <p>But the most im­­por­­tant thing here is to ac­­tu­al­­ly fol­low any ad­vice that the men­­tors give you.  If they tell you that you should ex­­pand your time­­line sec­­tion, you should ex­­pand your time­­line sec­­tion.  If they tell you you should dis­­­cuss the im­­ple­­men­­ta­­tion more, you should do that (see the next point).  If you don't fol­low the ad­vice, it looks to the men­­tor like you did­n't lis­ten to him, which does­n't make you ap­­pear like a good can­di­­date for ac­­cep­­tance.  Al­­so, the things that they tell you to im­prove will tend to be the things that they will look at when re­view­ing your pro­­pos­al.    </p></li> 
     <li><strong>Don't just dis­cuss the the­o­ry.</strong>  I sus­pect that this may be more of a prob­lem with SymPy than for oth­er or­ga­ni­za­tion­s, be­cause SymPy is very math based, so many of the pro­pos­als to SymPy in­volve com­plex math­e­mat­ic­s. One of the big­gest is­sues I saw in pro­pos­als was that stu­dents dis­cussed the the­o­ry of what they want­ed to im­ple­ment too much and not enough of the ac­tu­al im­ple­men­ta­tion. It's easy to do this, but dis­cussing the im­ple­men­ta­tion is ac­tu­al­ly more im­por­tant than the the­o­ry of what you want to do.  
 <p>An easy way to do this is to give a "fake" ex­am­­ple ses­­sion show­ing how your code might work af­ter it is com­­plet­ed.  For ex­am­­ple, if you were writ­ing a pro­­pos­al for a PDE solver, you might in­­­clude some­thing like</p>  
  <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p>  
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; u = Func­­tion('u')</p>  
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Solve the Heat Equa­­tion in one di­­men­­sion</p>  
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; pde­s­olve(u(x, t).d­if­f(t) - c*<em>2</em>u(x, t).d­if­f(x, x), u(x), {u(x, 0):f(x), u(0, t):0, u(0, pi):0}, method­­='sep­a­ra­­tion of var­i­ables')   </p>  
  <p>2/pi<em>Sum(In­te­­gral(f(x)</em>sin(n<em>x), x)</em>sin(n<em>x)</em>ex­p(-n<strong>2*c</strong>2*t), (n, 1, oo))</p>  
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Use Fouri­er Tran­s­­forms to get d'Alem­bert's So­lu­­tion to the Wave Equa­­tion</p>  
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; …</p>  
  <p>[/­­code]</p>  
  <p>in your pro­­pos­al.  Just say­ing "I plan to im­­ple­­ment solvers for PDEs us­ing sep­a­ra­­tion of var­i­ables and Fouri­er Tran­s­­for­m­s" tells us on­­ly what we al­ready know, which is that you can solve PDEs us­ing sep­a­ra­­tion of var­i­ables and Fouri­er Tran­s­­for­m­s.  What we don't know is how it will look.  The above ex­am­­ple shows how the PDE, in­i­­tial/bound­­ary con­di­­tion­s, and method are en­tered by the user, and how the out­­put look­s.    </p>  
  <p>A more ad­­vanced thing that you can do is to give ac­­tu­al pro­­to­­type code. This is not re­quired, but it can show that you are ded­i­­cat­ed enough to get a start, and can de­mon­s­trate how things will work for more com­­pli­­cat­ed pro­jec­t­s.</p></li> 
     <li><strong>But the­o­ry is im­por­tant too.</strong>  This might al­so be a prob­lem more in SymPy, but maybe not.  The math­e­mat­i­cal back­grounds of SymPy de­vel­op­ers ranges quite a bit.  For ex­am­ple, I know a lot about the com­pli­cat­ed Risch Al­go­rithm for sym­bol­ic in­te­gra­tion that the ma­jor­i­ty of peo­ple (even among SymPy de­vel­op­er­s) know hard­ly any­thing about, but I know ba­si­cal­ly noth­ing about quan­tum me­chan­ic­s.  So that more men­tors can have a chance to even have a clue about what you are talk­ing about when they are re­view­ing your pro­pos­al, you should try to ex­plain things to a gen­er­al au­di­ence, at least in the in­tro­duc­tion of your pro­pos­al.  It can al­so help to ex­plain why your project would be use­ful, so that even if some­one does­n't know what it is, they can see why it would be nice to have.  This does­n't mean that you should sac­ri­fice de­tails by dumb­ing ev­ery­thing down.  There's a pret­ty good chance that some­one will un­der­stand what you are talk­ing about in your specific­s, but you should al­so ex­plain things from the oth­er end.
 <p>If you are im­­ple­­men­t­ing a spe­­cif­ic al­­go­rith­m, maybe you could give a brief over­view of the al­­go­rith­m.  This will not on­­ly ex­­plain things to the men­­tors who might not know how it work­s, but al­­so it shows that you know how it works too.</p></li> 
     <li><strong>Be in­volved in the com­mu­ni­ty.</strong>  We un­der­stand that stu­dents have class­es dur­ing the ap­pli­ca­tion pe­ri­od, but the more you in­volve your­self in the com­mu­ni­ty be­yond the patch re­quire­ment (or what­ev­er re­quire­ment some oth­er org might have), the bet­ter your chances of be­ing ac­cept­ed. Ev­ery org has to take risks ac­cept­ing stu­dents, be­cause there is al­ways the chance that they will fail.  This is not good for any­one: the stu­dent does­n't get paid the full stipend and the or­ga­ni­za­tion loos­es not on­ly the project that would have been im­ple­ment­ed, but al­so the slot that they could have giv­en to some­one who would­n't have failed.  In­volv­ing your­self in the com­mu­ni­ty ear­ly is the best way to show the com­mu­ni­ty that you are a low risk for fail­ure.</li> 
     <li><strong>The pro­pos­al is the most im­por­tant thing.</strong>  But don't as­sume that just be­cause you are in­volved in the com­mu­ni­ty that you will be ac­cept­ed.  The most im­por­tant thing is the pro­pos­al.  If you don't have a good pro­pos­al, we will not even con­sid­er the rest of your ac­tiv­i­ty.  So you should fo­cus most of your en­er­gy on writ­ing a high qual­i­ty pro­pos­al.  The qual­i­ty of the patch and your in­volve­ment in the com­mu­ni­ty are sec­ondary con­sid­er­a­tions af­ter the qual­i­ty of the pro­pos­al.  These might be used to nar­row down the list of good pro­pos­als to fit the num­ber of slots Google gives us and the num­ber of men­tors we have avail­able, but the first phase is al­ways to nar­row down the list based on the qual­i­ty of the pro­pos­al­s.</li> 
     <li><strong>Use a con­sis­tant nick­name, prefer­ably one based on your re­al name.</strong>   This is some­thing that I think most peo­ple do not re­al­ize.  If your re­al name is John Smith, and your IRC nick, GitHub han­dle, Google Code han­dle, and GSoC link_id are all jsmith, it makes it very easy for me to as­so­ciate in my mind: "OK, that per­son who just sub­mit­ted that patch is the same per­son I talked to on IRC last week, and I re­mem­ber read­ing his pro­pos­al on google-me­lange.­com."  But if your re­al name is John Smith, your IRC nick is free­bird, your GitHub han­dle is mr.nice, your Google Code han­dle is smithy, and your link_id on google-me­lange.­com is johnh­smith, I can have a very hard time as­so­ci­at­ing your work in one place with your work in an­oth­er (my apolo­gies if those are any­bodys' re­al nick­names; I just made them up to make the point here).  Maybe you ac­tu­al­ly have been very ac­tive in the IRC chan­nel, but it is hard for me to re­al­ize that based on your nick vs. your re­al name.  This year for SymPy, we had 25 ap­pli­ca­tions by 25 stu­dents.  None of these stu­dents were mem­bers of the SymPy com­mu­ni­ty a few months ago.  It's very hard for the oth­er men­tors and I to keep track of which nick­names as­so­ciate with which peo­ple, and in the end, we may mis­tak­en­ly be­lieve that you haven't done as much as you re­al­ly have.  Your best bet is to use one nick­name ev­ery­where, and to make it based on your re­al name, so that we can eas­i­ly tell who it is even based on the nick­name.  If your name is com­mon enough that no one per­mu­ta­tion is guar­an­teed to be avail­able ev­ery­where, at least try to be con­sis­tent with your nick­name, or just use dif­fer­ent per­mu­ta­tions of your re­al name based on what site you are on.</li> 
 </ol>
<p>That's all I can think of for now.  I kind of wish I had thought of two more, so I could make it "Ten pieces of ad­vice," but what­ev­er.  If any SymPy men­tors or men­tors from oth­er projects feel that some­thing is miss­ing, I would love to hear about it in the com­ments.</p></div>

 <p>In case you don't know for some rea­son, Google Sum­mer of Code is a pro­gram where Google pays stu­dents to write code for open source project­s.  SymPy was ac­cept­ed as a men­tor­ing or­ga­ni­za­tion this year.  The goal of the sum­mer is to help the stu­dents learn new skill­s, in par­tic­u­lar in our case:  </p> 
 <ul>
<li> 
 <p>con­tribut­ing to open source   </p>  
  </li> 
 <li>

  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>learn git, pull re­quest­s, re­views   </p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>teach them how to re­view oth­­er's peo­­ple patch­es   </p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>do use­­ful work for SymPy   </p>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>I am proud to an­nounce that SymPy has been ac­cept­ed as a men­tor­ing or­ga­ni­za­tion for Google Sum­mer of Code 2011.  This is great news for the projec­t.  Al­though we have par­tic­i­pat­ed in the past un­der the um­brel­la of the Python Soft­ware Foun­da­tion and Port­land State Uni­ver­si­ty men­tor­ing or­ga­ni­za­tion­s, this is the first time that we have been ac­cept­ed as a men­tor­ing or­ga­ni­za­tion.  Out of 417 or­ga­ni­za­tions that ap­plied to Google, 175 were ac­cept­ed, 50 of which were new.</p> 
 <p>In case you don't know, Google Sum­mer of Code is a pro­gram run by Google ev­ery year where they pay col­lege stu­dents all around the world to write code for open source project­s. Each stu­dent has a men­tor as­signed to him/her, who helps the stu­dent get start­ed with in­ter­act­ing with open source (most stu­dents who are ac­cept­ed have nev­er par­tic­i­pat­ed in open source be­fore).   </p> 
 <p>So now that were are ac­cept­ed, stu­dents are open to ap­pli­ca­tion­s.  The ac­tu­al ap­pli­ca­tion pe­ri­od opens on March 28, and clos­es on April 8 (see  <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline">the pro­gram time­line</a>).</p> 
 <p>To stu­dents:</p> 
 <p>If you are in­ter­est­ed in ap­ply­ing, please write the to mail­ing list and in­tro­duce your­self.  The pro­gram is open to any­one world­wide who is 18 years of age or old­er who is en­rolled in a high­er ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tion (this in­cludes un­der­grad­u­ate and grad­u­ate).  If you are in­ter­est­ed in ap­ply­ing, here is what you should do (if you have not al­ready):</p> 
 <ul>
<li> 
 <p>As I said above, write to the list and in­­tro­­duce your­­self.  You might al­­so join our IRC chan­nel, which is #sympy on freen­ode.</p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>Start think­ing about what you want to ap­­ply to do.  See our   <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2011-Ideas">ideas page</a>.  How­ev­er, we are open to ideas that are not on that page. Any­thing that fits in a com­put­er al­ge­bra sys­tem would fit in SymPy.  If you have an idea not on that page, please dis­­­cuss it on our mail­ing list, so we can see if it has not al­ready be im­­ple­­men­t­ed, and if it is fit­t­ing for SymPy and for a pro­jec­t.  I rec­om­­mend you ap­­ply to do some­thing that you are in­­ter­est­ed in per­­son­al­­ly.</p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>We re­quire for any stu­­dent to be ac­­cep­t­ed that he/she sub­­mit at least one patch to SymPy, which gets re­viewed and pushed in.  See   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=label%3AEasyToFix">is­­sues la­­beled EasyToFix in our is­­sue track­­er</a>   for some easy to fix is­­sues that are a good place to start.  Don't wor­ry if you do not know how to send in a patch or use git.  We will help you (that is the whole point of the pro­­gram).  Just ask on the mail­ing list, on the is­­sue page, or on IR­C.</p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>You should start think­ing about your ap­­pli­­ca­­tion.  See our   <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2011-Application-Template">ap­­pli­­ca­­tion tem­­plate</a>   (it will al­­so be at our page on the Google site).  If you like, you can start a page on our wi­­ki to write your pro­­pos­al.  If you do this, we will help you ed­it it (though un­der­­s­tand that we will not help you write it).  Re­mem­ber that we want you to get ac­­cep­t­ed just as much as you do, so you can help im­prove SymPy!</p>  
  </li> 
 </ul>
<p>To SymPy de­vel­op­er­s:</p> 
 <ul>
<li> 
 <p>We need peo­­ple who are will­ing to men­­tor stu­­dents.  If you are will­ing to men­­tor, please add your name to the bot­­tom of the   <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2011-ideas">ideas page</a>.   </p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>Please ed­it the ideas page to im­prove for­­mat­t­ing and add new ideas.</p>  
  </li> 
 </ul>
<p>Good luck to all stu­dents who plan on ap­ply­ing!</p></div>

        <hr>
        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>Time for  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/modifying-a-list-while-looping-through-it-in-python/">an­oth­er</a>   <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/strange-python-behavior-can-someone-please-explain-to-me-what-is-going-on-here/">one</a>  of my WTF Python blog post­s.  Yes­ter­day, I ran­dom­ly typed this in a Python ses­sion (it was late at night):</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; True is True is False is True is False</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p> 
 <p>First a lit­tle back­ground, in case you don't know.  The  <code>is</code>  op­er­a­tor in Python does ex­act ob­ject com­par­i­son in mem­o­ry. Un­like  <code>==</code>, which on­ly com­pares it two ob­jects are equal,  <code>is</code>  on­ly re­turns True if both ar­gu­ments have the same mem­o­ry ad­dress.  So you can have some­thing like:</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 12345</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 12345</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p> 
 <p>Now, there are a hand­ful of Python built-ins that are al­ways equal one an­oth­er with the  <code>is</code>  op­er­a­tor.   <code>True</code>  and  <code>False</code>  are two such con­stants:</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = False</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = False</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; c == d</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; c is d</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p> 
 <p>Now, go­ing back to the above, we see that each  <code>is</code>  re­turns  <code>True</code>  or  <code>False</code>, which is then eval­u­at­ed with the next one.  Or at least that is what you would think is hap­pen­ing.  But go back and look at it again, and see if you can fig­ure out what it should eval­u­ate to.  You could prob­a­bly guess that some­thing was amiss from the fact that I was blog­ging about it.  If you haven't fig­ured it out al­ready, look at the fol­low­ing:</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; True is True is False is True is False</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; (((True is True) is False) is True) is False</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; True is (True is (False is (True is False)))</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p> 
 <p>So it seems that  <code>is</code>  does not as­so­ciate to the left or to the right.  Let's see if we can fig­ure out what is go­ing on.  First of­f,  <code>True is True</code>, etc. do be­have as you ex­pect them to:</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; True is True</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; False is False</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; True is False</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; False is True</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p> 
 <p>It is when we start us­ing mul­ti­ple  <code>is</code>s in the same state­ment that we start see­ing prob­lem­s:</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; False is False is False</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; (False is False) is False</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p> 
 <p>So what's go­ing on here?   <code>False is False</code>  is True, so maybe it is short­-­cir­cuit­ing some­how.   </p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; True is False is False</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; False is False is True</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p> 
 <p>No, that is not it.  Those re­duce to  <code>False is False</code>  and  <code>True is True</code>  when as­so­ci­at­ing to the left, re­spec­tive­ly, and  <code>True is True</code>  and  <code>True is True</code>  when as­so­ci­at­ing to the right.   </p> 
 <p>Fi­nal­ly, at this point, it oc­curs to me what is re­al­ly go­ing on.  Have you fig­ured it out too (or maybe you al­ready knew all along)?  Maybe you can guess it from this state­men­t, which us­es  <code>None</code>, an­oth­er built-in ob­ject that al­ways com­pares equal to it­self with the  <code>is</code>  op­er­a­tor:</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; None is None is None</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p> 
 <p>So you see what is hap­pen­ing?   <code>is</code>  does­n't as­so­ciate at al­l.  Rather, us­ing mul­ti­ple  <code>is</code>s in one state­ment does mul­ti­ple com­par­isons at once.  Any  <code>a is b is … x</code>  will re­turn  <code>True</code>  if  <code>a</code>,  <code>b</code>, …, and  <code>x</code>  are all equal by the  <code>is</code>  op­er­a­tor (they share the same iden­ti­ty or mem­o­ry ad­dress), and  <code>False</code>  oth­er­wise.  Ac­tu­al­ly, this is­n't sur­pris­ing, since  <code>==</code>  works the same way:</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; False == False == False</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; (False == False) == False</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p> 
 <p>This syn­tax can ac­tu­al­ly be use­ful to test equal­i­ty of three or more items at once ef­fi­cient­ly (Python will not eval­u­ate the same op­er­and more than on­ce, and it short cir­cuit­s).  But it can be con­fus­ing when com­par­ing with  <code>True</code>  or  <code>False</code>, since  <code>a is b</code>  and  <code>a == b</code>  them­selves eval­u­ate to one of those val­ues.  So re­mem­ber that it is NOT as­so­cia­tive in any way.  Rather, it acts as an n-way com­par­i­son.  </p> 
 <p>Fi­nal­ly, as  <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#summary">this ta­ble</a>  of op­er­a­tor prece­dence in Python shows,  <code>is</code>  and  <code>==</code>  have the same prece­dence in Python.  There­fore, it should be pos­si­ble to com­bine the two in these same state­men­t.  In­deed, you can:</p> 
 <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 12345</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 12345</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = b</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b == c</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b is c</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Be­cause this is False</p> 
 <p>...  </p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b</p> 
 <p>False</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; # But this is True</p> 
 <p>...  </p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; b is c</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; # So we get</p> 
 <p>...  </p> 
 <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b is c</p> 
 <p>True</p> 
 <p>[/­code]</p></div>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>You can imag­ine my sur­prise when I opened my email last Mon­day and saw this mes­sage from On­drej:</p> 
 <p></p><blockquote>
<p>Hi Aaron,</p> 
 <p>would you like to be­come the main main­tain­er/pro­ject lead­er for sympy?</p> 
 <p>In the last year, it is clear­ly you, who does most of the work, and</p> 
 <p>al­so your blog has quite some vis­i­bil­i­ty now.</p> 
 <p>It'd be cool to do some re­lease from time to time. Ma­teusz is</p> 
 <p>fin­ish­ing is poly's branch, so prob­a­bly his code would go in­to the</p> 
 <p>re­lease.</p> 
 </blockquote>

<p>So I guess now I am the project lead­er for SymPy.  As to what ex­act­ly this mean­s, I am not yet en­tire­ly sure, but so far it has meant that I get to do a lot more work than be­fore (yay!).</p> 
 <p>Ac­tu­al­ly, the work is be­cause I have spent the last week work­ing non­stop to get things ready to do a re­lease.  I should have a re­lease can­di­date for SymPy 0.7.0 ready some time next week.  I'll post more here about what's change, but this is go­ing to be a big re­lease.  The big­gest change will be the new polys, which makes things much faster and more pow­er­ful.   </p> 
 <p>Al­so, I will try to post things here re­lat­ing to SymPy as a whole, not just my work.   </p> 
 <p>On­drej, by the way, is­n't go­ing any­where. He plans on do­ing some work on ways to get SymPy out to more peo­ple by writ­ing more/­bet­ter web and mo­bile in­ter­faces for it.  A big thanks to On­drej and the SymPy com­mu­ni­ty for mak­ing such an awe­some piece of soft­ware!</p></div>

        <hr>
        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>I have been able to get to work again on the Risch Al­go­rithm now that I have a month win­ter break from class­es.  So the first thing I did was com­mit a bunch of bug fix­es that had been sit­ting there since the end of the sum­mer.  Then, I set out to make a ma­jor in­ter­nal API change to the en­tire Risch Al­go­rith­m.</p> 
 <p>Let me give some back­ground.  When I first start­ed pro­gram­ming the Risch Al­go­rithm at the be­gin­ning of the sum­mer, I did­n't have a very good idea of how dif­fer­en­tial ex­ten­sions worked yet (re­mem­ber that I pro­grammed the al­go­rithm as I learned it from Bron­stein's book).  Let me use the func­tion  <code>deriva­tion()</code>  to demon­strate how the API has changed.   <code>deriva­tion()</code>  takes the Poly  <code>p</code>  in  <code>t</code>  and com­putes the de­riv­a­tive (<code>t</code>  is some tran­scen­den­tal ex­ten­sion, like $la­tex e^x$).  Al­so, the in­te­gra­tion vari­able is  <code>x</code>.  The first in­ter­nal API that I used was</p> 
 <p><code>deriva­tion(p, D, x, t)</code></p> 
 <p>where  <code>D</code>  is a Poly of the de­riv­a­tive of  <code>t</code>, and  <code>x</code>  and  <code>t</code>  are Sym­bols (see  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/commit/0f6a3d90f724118fadc5fdaf290a0cb3e3963efd">this com­mit</a>).   The prob­lem here is that  <code>p</code>  might not be in just one sym­bol,  <code>t</code>, but in many. This would hap­pen when­ev­er the func­tion had more than one tran­scen­den­tal func­tion, or ex­ten­sion, in it.  So, for ex­am­ple, $la­tex e^x\log{x}$ would have this prob­lem. Sur­pris­ing­ly, ac­cord­ing to the git log, it took me un­til Ju­ly 4 to fig­ure this out (that above linked com­mit, which is the first oc­cur­rence of this func­tion and when I start­ed the full al­go­rith­m, dates from June 7, so it took me al­most a mon­th!), af­ter which I had al­ready writ­ten a good por­tion of the Risch Al­go­rith­m.  I changed the API to</p> 
 <p><code>deriva­tion(p, D, x, T)</code></p> 
 <p>where  <code>T</code>  is a list of the ex­ten­sion vari­ables and  <code>D</code>  is a list of the deriva­tions of the re­spec­tive el­e­ments of  <code>T</code>  with re­spect to the low­er el­e­ments and x (see  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/commit/20b7a5f8ca8dec579065f85583f11cc0955b96f0">this com­mit</a>).  Now, the deriva­tion of  <code>x</code>  is al­ways  <code>Poly(1, x)</code>, so I did­n't think it was nec­es­sary to in­clude it.  But it turns out that it is eas­i­er to just al­ways in­clude this in  <code>D</code>  rather than try to spe­cial case it in the code.  Al­so, the low­est ex­ten­sion vari­able,  <code>x</code>, is­n't used very of­ten in the code, so it al­so does­n't make much sense to keep it sep­a­rate from the rest of the vari­ables in  <code>T</code>.  Now this did­n't take me as long to fig­ure out (Ju­ly 11).  There­fore, I changed the API to just</p> 
 <p><code>deriva­tion(p, D, T)</code></p> 
 <p>where the first el­e­ment of  <code>T</code>  is al­ways  <code>x</code>  and the first el­e­ment of  <code>D</code>  is al­ways  <code>Poly(1, x)</code>  (see  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/commit/bca2b19844ae71aa1ef8e27a9f77eabb70b4aa5f">this com­mit</a>).</p> 
 <p>Now this API worked quite well for the re­main­der of the sum­mer.  How­ev­er, at the very end, I dis­cov­ered that a func­tion re­quired to han­dle some spe­cial cas­es in cer­tain parts of the al­go­rithm need­ed four more lists (the el­e­ments of the ex­ten­sion that are log­a­rithm­s, the el­e­ments of the ex­ten­sion that are ex­po­nen­tial­s, the ar­gu­ments of those log­a­rithm­s, and the ar­gu­ments of those ex­po­nen­tial­s).  I had pre­vi­ous­ly thought that these lists would on­ly be need­ed when cre­at­ing the ex­ten­sion at the be­gin­ning of in­te­gra­tion, but it turned out that this was not the case and that they could be need­ed in sev­er­al rather deep places in the al­go­rith­m.  The on­ly way to get them there would be to pass them through to ev­ery sin­gle func­tion in the al­go­rith­m.     </p> 
 <p>So I was faced with a dilem­ma.  I did­n't want to pass six ar­gu­ments through each func­tion just be­cause a few might need them al­l.  I knew that the an­swer was to cre­ate an ob­ject to store all the da­ta for a dif­fer­en­tial ex­ten­sion and to just pass this ob­ject around.  Un­for­tu­nate­ly, this hap­pened at the very end of the sum­mer, so I had­n't been able to do that un­til now.   </p> 
 <p>This brings us to now.  Over the past cou­ple of week­s, I cre­at­ed an ob­ject called  <code>Dif­fer­en­tialEx­ten­sion</code>, and re­placed the API in the Risch Al­go­rithm to use it.  See  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/commit/d9d9548625513188aaa663621bfe4e097aebf741">this com­mit</a>  and  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/commit/1935b6d6e1fdf8eae4deb5a4f56ea53c5d6989fa">this com­mit</a>  and some of the ones in be­tween to see what I did. More or less, the ob­ject is like a C struc­t---it does lit­tle more than hold a lot of in­for­ma­tion as at­tributes.  How­ev­er, at the sug­ges­tion of Ro­nan Lamy on the  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sympy/browse_thread/thread/a051b5ba1fb5cb4d">mail­ing list</a>, I have moved all the rel­e­vant code for build­ing the ex­ten­sion from the  <code>build_ex­ten­sion()</code>  func­tion in­to  <code>Dif­fer­en­tialEx­ten­sion.<strong>init</strong>()</code>.  I have al­so cre­at­ed some "mag­ic" to han­dle the re­cur­sive na­ture of the al­go­rith­m.  A Dif­fer­en­tialEx­ten­sion ob­ject has an at­tribute  <code>lev­el</code>, which rep­re­sents the lev­el of the ex­ten­sion that the al­go­rithm is work­ing in.  So you can store all the deriva­tions of the ex­ten­sion in  <code>Dif­fer­en­tialEx­ten­sion.D</code>, but on­ly have  <code>Dif­fer­en­tialEx­ten­sion.d</code>  point to the "cur­ren­t" out­er­most deriva­tion.  This re­places things like</p> 
 <p><code>D = D[:-1]</code></p> 
 <p>T = T[:-1]</p> 
 <p>   </p> 
 <p>from the old API to just</p> 
 <p><code>DE.decre­men­t_level()</code></p> 
 <p></p> 
 <p>(and then lat­er on,  <code>DE.in­cre­men­t_level()</code>).  The en­tire API is now just</p> 
 <p><code>deriva­tion(p, DE)</code></p> 
 <p>where  <code>DE</code>  is a  <code>Dif­fer­en­tialEx­ten­sion</code>  ob­jec­t.  Chang­ing the API of the en­tire code base at this point was a bit of work, but I have fi­nal­ly fin­ished it, and I must say, this is much clean­er.  True, you now have to use  <code>DE.t</code>  ev­ery­where in­stead of  <code>t</code>  (with  <code>t = T[-1]</code>  at the top of the func­tion), which is three char­ac­ters more space for ev­ery use, but I think in the end it is clean­er.  For ex­am­ple, the func­tion that used to be</p> 
 <p><code>is_log_deriv_k_t_rad­i­cal(­fa, fd, L_K, E_K, L_args, E_args, D, T)</code></p> 
 <p>is now just</p> 
 <p><code>is_log_deriv_k_t_rad­i­cal(­fa, fd, DE)</code>.</p> 
 <p>Al­so, be­cause it is an ob­jec­t, I can do cool things like over­ride  <code>Dif­fer­en­tialEx­ten­sion.<strong>str</strong>()</code>  to print out a tu­ple of the most im­por­tant at­tributes of the ob­jec­t, mak­ing de­bug­ging much eas­i­er (now there is just one print state­ment in­stead of five).   </p> 
 <p>An­oth­er thing I had to do was to al­low the cre­ation of these ob­jects man­u­al­ly, be­cause what is now  <code>Dif­fer­en­tialEx­ten­sion.<strong>init</strong>()</code>  can­not yet han­dle, for ex­am­ple, tan­gent ex­ten­sion­s, but some of the tests in­volve those.  So I cre­at­ed an  <code>ex­ten­sion</code>  flag to  <code><strong>init</strong>()</code>  to which you could pass a dic­tio­nary, and it would cre­ate a skele­ton ex­ten­sion from that (see  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/commit/7121b06eab3f1e0f8464c287438fb7175f07762b">this com­mit</a>).  I made it smart enough to cre­ate some at­tributes au­to­mat­i­cal­ly, so I on­ly have to pass the list  <code>D</code>  in most test­s---it cre­ates at­tributes like  <code>T</code>  from that au­to­mat­i­cal­ly.  Thus, this in some ways made the tests a lit­tle sim­pler, be­cause I did­n't have to wor­ry about  <code>T</code>  any more.   </p> 
 <p>We'll see how things go, but this fourth API change should hope­ful­ly be the last.  This should al­so make it much eas­i­er when­ev­er I add trigono­met­ric func­tion sup­port, where I will have to add even more at­tributes to the ob­jec­t.  I won't have to change the code in any ex­ist­ing func­tion (un­less it specif­i­cal­ly needs to be able to know about trig ex­ten­sion­s), be­cause, to them, the in­for­ma­tion in  <code>DE</code>  will not change.</p> 
 <p>So the good news be­hind all of this, as I men­tioned at the be­gin­ning of this post, is that I can now write some al­go­rithm that re­quires those  <code>L_K</code>,  <code>E_K</code>,  <code>L_args</code>,  <code>E_args</code>  vari­ables from ar­bi­trary places with­in the al­go­rith­m.  This should al­low me to com­plete­ly fin­ish the ex­po­nen­tial case.  So look for­ward soon to a  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>  that can han­dle com­plete­ly any tran­scen­den­tal func­tion of ex­po­nen­tials (ei­ther pro­duce an in­te­gral or prove that no el­e­men­tary in­te­gral ex­ist­s).   </p> 
 <p>And just to be clear, this does­n't change any­thing with  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>---this is on­ly an in­ter­nal change. And at the mo­men­t, it does­n't add any fea­tures, though that should soon change. So keep on test­ing it for me!  If you see any er­rors along the lines of "Vari­able t not de­fined," it prob­a­bly means that I missed that one when I was switch­ing the API due to poor test cov­er­age in that area of the code.  I would love to know about any er­rors you find, or, in­deed, any test­ing you do with  <code>risch_in­te­grate</code>.  Re­mem­ber that you can ob­tain my branch at  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/tree/integration3">my GitHub ac­count (branch in­te­gra­tion3)</a>.</p></div>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div><p></p><p>So this is the last of­fi­cial week of the Sum­mer of Code pro­gram, and my work is most­ly con­sist­ing of re­mov­ing  <code>NotIm­ple­ment­ed­Er­ror</code>s (i.e., im­ple­ment­ing stuff), and fix­ing bugs. None of this is par­tic­u­lar­ly in­ter­est­ing, so in­stead of talk­ing about that, I fig­ured I would pro­duce an­oth­er one of my Risch Al­go­rithm blog post­s.  It is rec­om­mend­ed that you read parts  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/the-risch-algorithm-part-1/">1</a>  and  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/07/24/the-risch-algorithm-part-2-elementary-functions/">2</a>  first, as well as my post on  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/integration-of-rational-functions/">ra­tio­nal func­tion in­te­gra­tion</a>, which could be con­sid­ered part 0.</p> 
 <p><strong>Li­ou­ville's The­o­rem</strong></p> 
 <p>Any­one who's tak­en cal­cu­lus in­tu­itive­ly knows that in­te­gra­tion is hard, while dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion is easy.  For dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion, we can pro­duce the de­riv­a­tive of any el­e­men­tary func­tion, and we can do so eas­i­ly, us­ing a sim­ple al­go­rithm con­sist­ing of the sum and prod­uct rules, the chain rule, and the rules for the de­riv­a­tive of all the var­i­ous el­e­men­tary func­tion­s.  But for in­te­gra­tion, we have to try to work back­ward­s.   </p> 
 <p>There are two things that make in­te­gra­tion dif­fi­cult.  First is the ex­is­tence of func­tions that sim­ply do not have any el­e­men­tary anti­deriv­a­tive.  $la­tex e^{-x^2}$ is per­haps the most fa­mous ex­am­ple of such a func­tion, since it aris­es from the nor­mal dis­tri­bu­tion in sta­tis­tics.  But there are many oth­er­s.  $la­tex \s­in{(x^2)}$, $la­tex \frac{1}{\log{(x)}}$, and $la­tex x^x$ are some oth­er ex­am­ples of fa­mous non-in­te­grable func­tion­s.   </p> 
 <p>The sec­ond prob­lem is that no one sin­gle sim­ple rule for work­ing back­wards will al­ways be ap­pli­ca­ble.  We know that u-­sub­sti­tu­tion and in­te­gra­tion by parts are the re­verse of the chain rule and the prod­uct rule, re­spec­tive­ly.  But those meth­ods will on­ly work if those rules were the ones that were ap­plied orig­i­nal­ly, and then on­ly if you chose the right $la­tex u$ and $la­tex dv$.   </p> 
 <p>But there is a much sim­pler ex­am­ple that gets right down to the point with Li­ou­ville's the­o­rem.  The pow­er rule, which is that $la­tex \frac{d}{dx}x^n=nx^{n-1}$ is eas­i­ly re­versed for in­te­gra­tion.  Giv­en the pow­er rule for dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion, it's easy to see that the re­verse rule should be $la­tex \in­t{x^ndx}=\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$.  This works fine, ex­cept that were are di­vid­ing some­thing, $la­tex n+1$.  In math­e­mat­ic­s, when­ev­er we do that, we have to en­sure that what­ev­er we di­vide by is not 0. In this case, it means that we must as­sert $la­tex n\neq -1$.  This ex­cludes $la­tex \in­t{\frac{1}{x}dx}$.  We know from cal­cu­lus that this in­te­gral re­quires us to in­tro­duce a spe­cial func­tion, the nat­u­ral log­a­rith­m.   </p> 
 <p>But we see that $la­tex n=-1$ is the on­ly ex­cep­tion to the pow­er rule, so that the in­te­gral of any (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_polynomial">Lau­rent</a>) poly­no­mi­al is again a (Lau­ren­t) poly­no­mi­al, plus a log­a­rith­m.  Re­call from part 0 (<a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/integration-of-rational-functions/">Ra­tio­nal Func­tion In­te­gra­tion</a>) that the same thing is true for any ra­tio­nal func­tion: the in­te­gral is again a ra­tio­nal func­tion, plus a log­a­rithm (we can com­bine mul­ti­ple log­a­rithms in­to one us­ing the log­a­rith­mic iden­ti­ties, so as­sume for sim­plic­i­ty that there is just one).  The ar­gu­ment is very sim­i­lar, too.  As­sume that we have split the de­nom­i­na­tor ra­tio­nal func­tion in­to lin­ear fac­tors in the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_splitting_field">al­ge­bra­ic split­ting field</a>  (such as the com­plex num­ber­s).  Then per­form a par­tial frac­tions de­com­po­si­tion on the ra­tio­nal func­tion.  Each term in the de­com­po­si­tion will be ei­ther a poly­no­mi­al, or of the form $la­tex \frac{a}{(x - b)^n}$. The in­te­gra­tion of these terms is the same as with the pow­er rule, mak­ing the sub­sti­tu­tion $la­tex u = x - b$. When $la­tex n\geq 2$, the in­te­gral will be $la­tex \frac{-1}{n - 1}\frac{a}{(x - b)^{n - 1}}$; when $la­tex n = 1$, the in­te­gral will be $la­tex a\log{(x - b)}$.  Now com­pu­ta­tion­al­ly, we don't want to work with the al­ge­bra­ic split­ting field, but it turns out that we don't need to ac­tu­al­ly com­pute it to find the in­te­gral.  But the­o­ry is what we are deal­ing with here, so don't wor­ry about that.   </p> 
 <p>Now the key ob­ser­va­tion about dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion, as I have point­ed out in the ear­li­er parts of this blog post se­ries,  is that the de­riv­a­tive of an el­e­men­tary func­tion can be ex­pressed in terms of it­self, in par­tic­u­lar, as a poly­no­mi­al in it­self.  To put it an­oth­er way, func­tions like $la­tex e^x$, $la­tex \tan{(x)}$, and $la­tex \log{(x)}$ all sat­is­fy lin­ear dif­fer­en­tial equa­tions with ra­tio­nal co­ef­fi­cients (e.g., for the­se, $la­tex y'=y$, $la­tex y'=1 + y^2$, and $la­tex y'=\frac{1}{x}$).   </p> 
 <p>Now, the the­o­ry gets more com­pli­cat­ed, but it turns out that, us­ing a care­ful anal­y­sis of this fac­t, we can prove a sim­i­lar re­sult to the one about ra­tio­nal func­tions to any el­e­men­tary func­tion. In a nut­shel­l, Li­ou­ville's The­o­rem says this:  if an el­e­men­tary func­tion has an el­e­men­tary in­te­gral, then that in­te­gral is a com­posed on­ly of func­tions from the orig­i­nal in­te­grand, plus a fi­nite num­ber of log­a­rithms of func­tions from the in­te­grand, which can be con­sid­ered one log­a­rith­m, as men­tioned above ("­func­tions from" more specif­i­cal­ly means a ra­tio­nal func­tion in the terms from our el­e­men­tary ex­ten­sion).  Here is the for­mal state­ment of the the­o­rem.</p> 
 <p><strong>The­o­rem (Liou­ville's The­o­rem - Strong ver­sion)</strong></p> 
 <p><em>Let $la­tex K$ be a dif­fer­en­tial field, $la­tex C=\­math­rm{­Con­st}(K)$, and $la­tex f\in K$. If there ex­ist an el­e­men­tary ex­ten­sion $la­tex E$ of $la­tex K$ and $la­tex g \in E$ such that $la­tex Dg =f$, then there are $la­tex v \in K$, $la­tex c_1, \dot­s, c_n\in \bar{C}$, and $la­tex u_1, \dot­s,u_n\in K(c_1,\­dot­s,c_n)^*$ such that  </em></p> 
 <h2>

$latex f = Dv + \sum_{i=1}^n c_i\frac{Du_i}{u_i}$.

</h2>

<p></p> 
 <p>Look­ing close­ly at the for­mal state­ment of the the­o­rem, we can see that it says the same thing as my "in a nut­shel­l" state­men­t.  $la­tex K$ is the dif­fer­en­tial ex­ten­sion, say of $la­tex \math­b­b{Q}(x)$, that con­tains all of our el­e­men­tary func­tions (see  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/07/24/the-risch-algorithm-part-2-elementary-functions/">part 2</a>).  $la­tex E$ is an ex­ten­sion of $la­tex K$.  The whole state­ment of the the­o­rem is that $la­tex E$ need not be ex­tend­ed from $la­tex K$ by any­thing more than some log­a­rithm­s.   $la­tex f$ is our orig­i­nal func­tion and $la­tex g=\int f$.  Re­call from  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/the-risch-algorithm-part-1/">part 1</a>  that $la­tex Dg = \frac{­Du}{u}$ is just an­oth­er way of say­ing that $la­tex g = \log{(u)}$.  The rest of the for­mal state­ment is some specifics deal­ing with the con­stant field, which as­sure us that we do not need to in­tro­duce any new con­stants in the in­te­gra­tion. This fact is ac­tu­al­ly im­por­tant to the de­cid­abil­i­ty of the Risch Al­go­rith­m, be­cause many prob­lems about con­stants are ei­ther un­known or un­de­cid­able (such as the tran­scen­dence de­gree of $la­tex \math­b­b{Q}(e, \pi)$).  But this en­sures us that as long as we start with a con­stant field that is com­putable, our con­stant field for our anti­deriv­a­tive will al­so be com­putable, and will in fact be the same field, ex­cept for some pos­si­ble al­ge­bra­ic ex­ten­sions (the $la­tex c_i$).   </p> 
 <p>At this point, I want to point out that even though my work this sum­mer has been on­ly on the pure­ly tran­scen­den­tal case of the Risch Al­go­rith­m, Li­ou­ville's The­o­rem is true for all el­e­men­tary func­tion­s, which in­cludes al­ge­bra­ic func­tion­s.  How­ev­er, if you re­view the proof of the the­o­rem, the proof of the al­ge­bra­ic part is com­plete­ly dif­fer­ent from the proof of the tran­scen­den­tal part, which is the first clue that the al­ge­bra­ic part of the al­go­rithm is com­plete­ly dif­fer­ent from the tran­scen­den­tal part (and al­so a clue that it is hard­er).</p> 
 <p>Li­ou­ville's The­o­rem is what al­lows us to prove that a giv­en func­tion does not have an el­e­men­tary an­tideriva­tive, by giv­ing us the form that any anti­deriv­a­tive must have.  We first per­form the same Her­mite Re­duc­tion from the  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/integration-of-rational-functions/">ra­tio­nal in­te­gra­tion case</a>. Then, a gen­er­al­iza­tion of the same Lazard-Ri­o­boo-­Trager Al­go­rithm due to Roth­stein al­lows us to find the log­a­rith­mic part of any in­te­gral (the $la­tex \sum_{i=1}^n c_i\frac{­Du_i}{u_i}$ from Li­ou­ville's The­o­rem).   </p> 
 <p>Now a dif­fer­ence here is that some­times, the part of the in­te­grand that cor­re­sponds to the $la­tex \frac{a}{x - b}$ for gen­er­al func­tions does­n't al­ways have an el­e­men­tary in­te­gral (these are called  <em>sim­ple</em>  func­tion­s.  I think I will talk about them in more de­tail in a fu­ture post in this se­ries).   An ex­am­ple of this is $la­tex \frac{1}{\log{(x)}}$.  Suf­fice it to say that any el­e­men­tary in­te­gral of $la­tex \frac{1}{\log{(x)}}$ must be part of some log-ex­ten­sion of $la­tex \math­b­b{Q}(x, \log{(x)})$, and that we can prove that no such log­a­rith­mic ex­ten­sion ex­ists in the course of try­ing to com­pute it with the Lazard-Ri­o­boo-Roth­stein-­Trager Al­go­rith­m.</p> 
 <p>In the ra­tio­nal func­tion case, af­ter we found the ra­tio­nal part and the log­a­rith­mic part, we were prac­ti­cal­ly done, be­cause the on­ly re­main­ing part was a poly­no­mi­al.  Well, for the gen­er­al tran­scen­den­tal func­tion case, we are left with an ana­logue, which are called  <em>re­duced</em>  func­tion­s, and we are far from done.  This is the hard­est part of the in­te­gra­tion al­go­rith­m.  This will al­so be the top­ic of a fu­ture post in this se­ries.  Suf­fice it to say that this is where most of the proofs of non-in­te­gra­bil­i­ty come from, in­clud­ing the oth­er in­te­grals than $la­tex \frac{1}{\log{(x)}}$ that I gave above.   </p> 
 <p><strong>Con­clu­sion</strong></p> 
 <p>That's it for now.  Orig­i­nal­ly, I was al­so go­ing to in­clude a bit on the struc­ture the­o­rems too, but I think I am go­ing to save that for part 4 in­stead.  I may or may not have an­oth­er post ready be­fore the of­fi­cial end of cod­ing date for Google Sum­mer of Code, which is Mon­day (three days from now).  I want to make a post with some nice graphs com­par­ing the tim­ings of the new  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>  and the old  <code>heurisch()</code>  (what is cur­rent­ly be­hind SymPy's  <code>in­te­grate()</code>).  But as I have said be­fore, I plan on con­tin­u­ing cod­ing the in­te­gra­tion al­go­rithm be­yond the pro­gram un­til I fin­ish it, and even be­yond that (there are lots of cool ways that the al­go­rithm can be ex­tend­ed to work with spe­cial func­tion­s, there's def­i­nite in­te­gra­tion with Mei­jer-G func­tion­s, and there's of course the al­ge­bra­ic part of the al­go­rith­m, which is a much larg­er chal­lenge).  And along with it, I plan to con­tin­ue keep­ing you up­dat­ed with blog post­s, in­clud­ing at least all the Risch Al­go­rithm se­ries posts that I have promised (I have count­ed at least three top­ics that I have ex­plic­it­ly promised but haven't done yet).  And of course, there will be the manda­to­ry GSoC wrap-up blog post, de­tail­ing my work for the sum­mer.   </p> 
 <p>Please con­tin­ue to test my pro­to­type  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/prototype-risch_integrate-function-ready-for-testing/"><code>risch_in­te­grate()</code></a>  func­tion in my  <a href="http://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/tree/integration3">in­te­gra­tion3</a>  branch, and tell me what you think (or if you find a bug).</p></div>
