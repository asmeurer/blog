</blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p><strong>EDIT: Some people have started working on making this happen. See
<a href="https://python3statement.github.io/">https://python3statement.github.io/</a>.</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who don't know, Python 2.7 is
<a href="https://docs.python.org/devguide/#status-of-python-branches">slated</a> to reach
end-of-life in 2020 (originally, it was slated to end in 2015, but it was
extended in 2014, due to the extraordinary difficulty of moving to a newer
version). "End-of-life" means absolutely no more support from the core Python
team, even for security updates.</p>
<p>I'm writing this post because I want to clarify why I think this should be
done, and to clear up some misconceptions, the primary one being that this
represents library developers being antagonistic against those who want or
have to use Python 2.</p>
<p>I'm writing this from my perspective as a library developer. I'm the lead
developer of <a href="http://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a>, and I have sympathies for
developers of other libraries.<sup id="fnref-sympy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/moving-away-from-python-2/#fn-sympy">1</a></sup> I say this because my idea may seem a bit
in tension with "users" (even though I hate the "developer/user" distinction).</p>
<h3>Python 2</h3>
<p>There are a few reasons why I think libraries should drop (and announce that
they will drop) Python 2 support by 2020 (actually earlier, say 2018 or 2019,
depending on how core the library is).</p>
<p>First, library developers have to be the leaders here. This is apparent from
the historical move to Python 3 up to this point. Consider the three (not
necessarily disjoint) classes of people: CPython core developers, library
developers, and users. The core developers were the first to move to Python 3,
since they were the ones who wrote it. They were also the ones who provided
the messaging around Python 3, which has varied over time. In my opinion, it
should have been and should be more forceful.<sup id="fnref-core"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/moving-away-from-python-2/#fn-core">2</a></sup> Then you have the library
developers and the users. A chief difference here is that users are probably
going to be using only one version of Python. In order for them to switch that
version to Python 3, all the libraries that they use need to support it. This
took some time, since library developers saw little impetus to support Python
3 when no one was using it (Catch 22), and to worsen the situation, versions
of Python older than 2.6 made
<a href="https://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2013/08/22/python-3-single-codebase-vs-2to3/">single codebase compatibility</a>
almost impossible.</p>
<p>Today, though, <a href="http://py3readiness.org/">almost all libraries</a> support Python
3, and we're reaching a point where those that don't have
forks that do.</p>
<p>But it only happened <em>after</em> the library developers transitioned. I believe
libraries need to be the leaders in moving away from Python 2 as well. It's
important to do this for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Python 2.7 support ends in 2020. That means all updates, including security
  updates. For all intents and purposes, Python 2.7 becomes an insecure
  language to use at that point in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting two major versions of Python is technical debt for every project
  that does it. While writing cross compatible code is
  <a href="http://python-future.org/">easier than ever</a>, it still remains true that
  you have to remember to add <code>__future__</code> imports to the top of every file,
  to import all relevant builtins from your compatibility file or library, and
  to run all your tests in both Python 2 and 3. Supporting both versions is a
  major cognitive burden to library developers, as they always have to be
  aware of important differences in the two languages. Developers on any
  library that does anything with strings will need to understand how things
  work in both Python 2 and 3, and the often obscure workarounds required for
  things to work in both (pop quiz: how do you write Unicode characters to a
  file in a Python 2/3 compatible way?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of Python 3's
  <a href="https://asmeurer.github.io/python3-presentation/slides.html">new syntax features</a>
  (i.e., features that are impossible to use in Python 2) only matter for
  library developers. A great example of this is
  <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/">keyword-only arguments</a>. From an
  API standpoint, almost every instance of keyword arguments should be
  implemented as keyword-only arguments. This avoids mistakes that come from
  the antipattern of passing keyword arguments without naming the keyword, and
  allows the argspec of the function to be expanded in the future without
  breaking API.<sup id="fnref-swift"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/moving-away-from-python-2/#fn-swift">3</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second reason I think library developers should agree to drop Python 2
support by 2020 is completely selfish. A response that I heard on that tweet
(as well as elsewhere), was that libraries should provide carrots, not sticks.
In other words, instead of forcing people off of Python 2, we should make them
want to come to Python 3. There are some issues with this argument. First,
Python 3 already has
<a href="https://asmeurer.github.io/python3-presentation/slides.html">tons of carrots</a>.
Honestly, not being terrible at Unicode ought to be a carrot in its own right.<sup id="fnref-unicode"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/moving-away-from-python-2/#fn-unicode">4</a></sup></p>
<p>If you don't deal with strings, or do but don't care about those silly
foreigners with weird accents in their names, there are other major carrots as
well. For SymPy, the fact that 1/2 gives 0 in Python 2 has historically been a
major source of frustration for new users. Imagine writing out <code>1/2*x +
x**(1/2)*y*z - 3*z**2</code> and wondering why half of what you wrote just
"disappeared" (granted, this was worse before we
<a href="https://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/sqrtx-now-prints-as-sqrtx/">fixed the printers</a>).
While <code>integer/integer</code> not giving a rational number is a major
<a href="http://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/gotchas.html#two-final-notes-and">gotcha</a>
for SymPy, giving a float is infinitely better than giving what is effectively
the wrong answer. Don't use strings or integers?
<a href="https://asmeurer.github.io/python3-presentation/slides.html">I've got more</a>.</p>
<p>Frankly, if these "carrots" haven't convinced you yet, then I'll wager you're
not really the sort of person who is persuaded by carrots.</p>
<p>Second, some "carrots" are impossible unless they are implemented in
libraries. While some features can be implemented in 2/3 compatible code and
only work in Python 3 (such as <code>@</code> matrix multiplication), others, such as
keyword-only arguments, can only be implemented in code that does not support
Python 2. Supporting them in Python 2 would be a net deficit of technical debt
(one can imagine, for instance, trying to support keyword-only arguments
manually using <code>**kwargs</code>, or by using some monstrous meta-programming).</p>
<p>Third, as I said, I'm selfish. Python 3 <em>does</em> have carrots, and I want them.
As long as I have to support Python 2 in my code, I can't use keyword-only
arguments, or extended argument unpacking, or async/await, or any of the
dozens of features that can't be used in cross compatible code.</p>
<p>A counterargument might be that instead of blocking users of existing
libraries, developers should create new libraries which are Python 3-only and
make use of new exciting features of Python 3 there. I agree we should do
that, but existing libraries are good too. I don't see why developers should
throw out all of a well-developed library just so they can use some Python
features that they are excited about.</p>
<h3>Legacy Python</h3>
<p>A lot of people have taken to calling Python 2
"<a href="https://twitter.com/RipLegacyPython">legacy Python</a>". This phrase is often
used condescendingly and
<a href="https://twitter.com/stephtdouglas/status/713433933040340993">angers a lot of people</a>
(and indeed, this blog post is the first time I've used it myself). However, I
think Python 2 really should be seen this way, as a "legacy" system. If you
want to use it, for whatever your reasons, that's fine, but just as you
shouldn't expect to get any of the newest features of Python, you shouldn't
expect to be able to use the newest versions of your libraries. Those
libraries that have a lot of development resources may choose to support older
Python 2-compatible versions with bug and/or security fixes. Python 2 itself
will be supported for these until 2020. Those without resources probably won't
(keep in mind that you're using open source libraries without paying money for
them).</p>
<p>I get that some people have to use Python 2, for whatever reasons. But using
outdated software comes at a cost. Libraries have borne this technical debt
for the most part thus far, but they shouldn't be expected to bear it forever.
The debt will only increase, especially as the technical opportunity cost, if
you will, of not being able to use newer and shinier versions of Python 3
grows. The burden will have to shift at some point. Those with the financial
resources may choose to offload this debt to others,<sup id="fnref-continuum"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/moving-away-from-python-2/#fn-continuum">5</a></sup> say, by
backporting features or bugfixes to older library versions that support Python
2 (or by helping to move code to Python 3).</p>
<p>I want to end by pointing out that if you are, for whatever reason, still
using Python 2, you may be worried that if libraries become Python 3-only and
start using Python 3 features, won't that break your code? The answer is no.
Assuming package maintainers mark the metadata on their packages correctly,
tools like pip and conda will not install non-Python 2 compatible versions
into Python 2.</p>
<p>If you haven't transitioned yet, and want to know more, a good place to start
is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html">official docs</a>. I also
highly recommend using <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/docs/">conda</a> environments, as
it will make it easy to separate your Python 2 code from your Python 3 code.</p>

<p>This is unsupported except in Python 3, because to fix the issue,
every single place in conda where a string appears would have to be

things like <code>'Ï€' + u'i'</code> raise <code>UnicodeDecodeError</code> in Python 2 (even

<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21msg/sympy/pJ2jg2csKgU/0nn21xqZEmwJ">a message</a>
to the SymPy mailing list.</em></p>
<h2>What is hashing?</h2>
<p>Before we start, let's have a brief introduction to hashing. A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"><em>hash function</em></a> is a function
that maps a set of objects to a set of integers. There are many kinds of hash
functions, which satisfy many different properties, but the most important
property that must be satisfied by any hash function is that it be a function
(in the mathematical sense), that is, if two objects are equal, then their
hash should also be equal.</p>
<p>Usually, the set of integers that the hash function maps to is much smaller
than the set of objects, so that there will be multiple objects that hash to
the same value. However, generally for a hash function to be useful, the set
of integers should be large enough, and the hash function well distributed
enough that if two objects hash to the same value, then they are very likely
to be equal.</p>
<p>To summarize, a hash function <em>must</em> satisfy the property:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If two objects are equal, then their hashes should be equal.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, a <em>good</em> hash function should satisfy the property:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If two objects have the same hash, then they are likely to be the same
object.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Since there are generally more possible objects than hash values, two objects
may hash to the same value. This is called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision">hash collision</a>, and anything
that deals with hashes should be able to deal with them.</p>
<p>This won't be discussed here, but an additional property that a good hash
function should satisfy to be useful is this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The hash of an object should be cheap to compute.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>What is it used for?</h2>
<p>If we have a hash function that satisfies the above properties, then we can
use it to create from a collection of objects something called a <em>hash table</em>.
Suppose we have a collection of objects, and given any object, we want to be
able to compute very quickly if that object belongs to our collection. We
could store these objects in an ordered array, but then to determine if it is
in the array, we would have to search potentially through every element of the
array (in other words, an \(O(n)\)) algorithm.</p>
<p>With hashing, we can do better. We create what is known as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table"><em>hash table</em></a>. Instead of storing
the objects in an ordered array, we create an array of buckets, each
corresponding to some hash values. We then hash each object, and store it into
the array corresponding to its hash value (if there are more hash values than
buckets, we distribute them using a second hash function, which can be as
simple as taking the modulus with respect to the number of buckets, <code>% n</code>).</p>
<p>This image from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hash_table_3_1_1_0_1_0_0_SP.svg">Wikipedia</a>
shows an example.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Hash_table_3_1_1_0_1_0_0_SP.svg" alt="img"></p>
<p>To determine if an object is in a hash table, we only have to hash the object,
and look in the bucket corresponding to that hash. This is an \(O(1)\)
algorithm, assuming we have a good hash function, because each bucket will
generally hold very few objects, possibly even none.</p>
<p><em>Note: there are some additional things that need to be done to handle hash
collisions, but the basic idea is the same, and as long as there aren't too
many hash collisions, which should happen if hash values are evenly
distributed and the size of the hash table is large compared to the number of
objects stored in it, the average time to determine if an object is in the
hash table is still \(O(1)\).</em></p>
<h2>Hashing in Python</h2>
<p>Python has a built in function that performs a hash called <code>hash()</code>.  For many
objects, the hash is not very surprising.  Note, the hashes you see below may
not be the same ones you see if you run the examples, because Python hashing
depends on the architecture of the machine you are running on, and, in newer
versions of Python, hashes are randomized for security purposes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(10)
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(()) # An empty tuple
3527539
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash('a')
12416037344
</code></pre>
<p>In Python, not all objects are hashable. For example</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; hash([]) # An empty list
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
</code></pre>
<p>This is because Python has an additional restriction on hashing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In order for an object to be hashable, it must be immutable.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is important basically because we want the hash of an object to remain
the same across the object's lifetime. But if we have a mutable object, then
that object itself can change over its lifetime. But then according to our
first bullet point above, that object's hash has to change too.</p>
<p>This restriction simplifies hash tables. If we allowed an object's hash to
change while it is in a hash table, we would have to move it to a different
bucket. Not only is this costly, but the hash table would have to <em>notice</em>
that this happened; the object itself doesn't know that it is sitting in a
hash table, at least not in the Python implementation.</p>
<p>In Python, there are two objects that correspond to hash tables, <code>dict</code> and
<code>set</code>. A <code>dict</code> is a special kind of hash table called an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array"><em>associative array</em></a>. An
associative array is a hash table where each element of the hash table points
to another object. The other object itself is not hashed.</p>
<p>Think of an associative array as a generalization of a regular array (like a
<code>list</code>). In a <code>list</code>, objects are associated to nonnegative integer indices,
like</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ['a', 'b', 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; l[0]
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; l[2]
7
</code></pre>
<p>In an associative array (i.e., a <code>dict</code>) we can index objects by anything, so
long as the key is hashable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {0: 'a', 'hello': ['world']}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[0]
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; d['hello']
['world']
</code></pre>
<p>Note that only the keys need to be hashable. The values can be anything, even
unhashable objects like lists.</p>
<p>The uses for associative arrays are boundless. <code>dict</code> is one of the most
useful data types in the Python language. Some example uses are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extension of <code>list</code> with "missing values". For example, <code>{0: 'a', 2: 7}</code>
would correspond to the above list <code>l</code> with the value <code>'b'</code> corresponding to
the key <code>1</code> removed.</p>

of the switch-case statement.</p>

<p>The other type of hash table, <code>set</code>, more closely matches the definition I
gave above for a hash table. A <code>set</code> is just a container of hashable
objects. <code>set</code>s are unordered, and can only contain one of each object (this
is why they are called "sets," because this matches the mathematical
definition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">set</a>).</p>
<p>In Python 2.7 or later, you can create a set with <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>, like <code>{a, b, c}</code>. Otherwise, use <code>set([a, b, c])</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; s = {0, (), '2'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
{0, '2', ()}
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.add(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
{0, 1, '2', ()}
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.add(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
{0, 1, '2', ()}
</code></pre>
<p>A final note: <code>set</code> and <code>dict</code> are themselves mutable, and hence not hashable!
There is an immutable version of <code>set</code> called <code>frozenset</code>. There are no
immutable dictionaries.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; f = frozenset([0, (), '2'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; f
frozenset({0, '2', ()})
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(f)
-7776452922777075760
&gt;&gt;&gt; # A frozenset, unlike a set, can be used as a dictionary key
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[f] = 'a set'
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{0: 'a', frozenset({0, '2', ()}): 'a set', 'hello': ['world']}
</code></pre>
<h2>Creating your own hashable objects</h2>
<p>Before we move on, there is one final thing we need to know about hashing in
Python, which is how to create hashes for custom objects. By default, if we
create an object, it will be hashable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; class Nothing(object):
...     pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; N = Nothing()
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(N)
270498113
</code></pre>
<p>Implementation-wise, the hash is just the object's <code>id</code>, which corresponds to
its position in memory. This satisfies the above conditions: it is (extremely)
cheap to compute, and since by default objects in Python compare unequal to
one another, objects with different hashes will be unequal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; M = Nothing()
&gt;&gt;&gt; M == N
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(M)
270498117
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(M) == hash(N)
False
</code></pre>
<p>To define a hash function for an object, define the <code>__hash__</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; class HashToOne(object):
...     def __hash__(self):
...         return 1
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; HTO = HashToOne()
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(HTO)
1
</code></pre>
<p>To set an object as not hashable, set <code>__hash__</code> to <code>None</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; class NotHashable(object):
...     __hash__ = None
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; NH = NotHashable()
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(NH)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unhashable type: 'NotHashable'
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, to override the equality operator <code>==</code>, define <code>__eq__</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; class AlwaysEqual(object):
...     def __eq__(self, other):
...         if isinstance(other, AlwaysEqual):
...             return True
...         return False
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; AE1 = AlwaysEqual()
&gt;&gt;&gt; AE2 = AlwaysEqual()
&gt;&gt;&gt; AE1 == AE2
True
</code></pre>
<p>One of the key points that I hope you will take away from this post is that if
you override <code>__eq__</code> and you want a hashable object, you <strong>must</strong> also
override <code>__hash__</code> to agree. Note that Python 3 will actually require this:
in Python 3, if you override <code>__eq__</code>, it automatically sets <code>__hash__</code> to
<code>None</code>, making the object unhashable. You need to manually override <code>__hash__</code>
to make it hashable again. But that's as far as Python goes in enforcing these
rules, as we will see below. In particular, Python will never actually check
that your <code>__hash__</code> actually agrees with your <code>__eq__</code>.</p>
<h2>Messing with hashing</h2>
<p>Now to the fun stuff. What happens if we break some of the invariants that
Python expects of hashing. Python expects two key invariants to hold</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The hash of an object does not change across the object's lifetime (in
other words, a hashable object should be immutable).</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>a == b</code> implies <code>hash(a) == hash(b)</code> (note that the reverse might not
hold in the case of a hash collision).</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As we shall see, Python expects, but does not enforce either of these.</p>
<h3>Example 1: Mutating a hash</h3>
<p>Let's break rule 1 first. Let's create an object with a hash, and then change
that object's hash over its lifetime, and see what sorts of things can happen.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bad(object):
...     def __init__(self, hash): # The object's hash will be hash
...         self.hash = hash
...     def __hash__(self):
...         return self.hash
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Bad(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(b)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {b:42}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[b]
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.hash = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(b)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[b]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
KeyError: &lt;__main__.Bad object at 0x1047e7438&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we implicitly changed the hash of <code>b</code> by mutating the attribute of <code>b</code>
that is used to compute the hash. As a result, the object is no longer found
in a dictionary, which uses the hash to find the object.</p>
<p>The object is still there, we just can't access it any more.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{&lt;__main__.Bad object at 0x1047e7438&gt;: 42}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that Python doesn't prevent me from doing this. We could make it if we
want (e.g., by making <code>__setattr__</code> raise <code>AttributeError</code>), but even then we
could forcibly change it by modifying the object's <code>__dict__</code>. We could try
some more fancy things using descriptors, metaclasses, and/or
<code>__getattribute__</code>, but even then, if we knew what was happening, we could
probably find a way to change it.</p>
<p>This is what is meant when people say that Python is a "consenting adults"
language. You are expected to not try to break things, but generally aren't
prevented from doing so if you try.</p>
<h3>Example 2: More mutation</h3>
<p>Let's try something even more crazy. Let's make an object that hashes to a
different value each time we look at the hash.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; class DifferentHash(object):
...     def __init__(self):
...         self.hashcounter = 0
...     def __hash__(self):
...         self.hashcounter += 1
...         return self.hashcounter
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; DH = DifferentHash()
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(DH)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(DH)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(DH)
3
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, if we use <code>DH</code> as a key to a dictionary, then it will not work,
because we will run into the same issue we had with <code>Bad</code>. But what about
putting <code>DH</code> in a <code>set</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; DHset = {DH, DH, DH}
&gt;&gt;&gt; DHset
{&lt;__main__.DifferentHash at 0x101f79f50&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.DifferentHash at 0x101f79f50&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.DifferentHash at 0x101f79f50&gt;}
</code></pre>
<p>Woah! We put the exact same object in a <code>set</code> three times, and it appeared all
three times. This is not what is supposed to happen with a set.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; {1, 1, 1}
{1}
</code></pre>
<p>What happens when we do stuff with <code>DHset</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; DHset.remove(DH)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
KeyError: &lt;__main__.DifferentHash object at 0x1047e75f8&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That didn't work, because <code>set.remove</code> searches for an object by its hash,
which is different by this point.</p>
<p>Now let's make a copy of <code>DHset</code>. The <code>set.copy</code> method will create a shallow
copy (meaning that the set container itself will be different, according to
<code>is</code> comparison, but the objects themselves will the same, according to <code>is</code>
comparison).</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; DHset2 = DHset.copy()
&gt;&gt;&gt; DHset2 == DHset
True
</code></pre>
<p>Everything is fine so far. This object is only going to cause trouble if
something recomputes its hash. But remember that the whole reason that we had
trouble with something like <code>Bad</code> above is that Python <em>doesn't</em> recompute
that hash of an object, unless it has to. So let's do something that will
force it to do so: let's pop an object from one of the sets and add it back
in.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; D = DHset.pop()
&gt;&gt;&gt; DHset.add(D)
&gt;&gt;&gt; DHset
{&lt;__main__.DifferentHash at 0x101f79f50&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.DifferentHash at 0x101f79f50&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.DifferentHash at 0x101f79f50&gt;}
&gt;&gt;&gt; DHset2
{&lt;__main__.DifferentHash at 0x101f79f50&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.DifferentHash at 0x101f79f50&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.DifferentHash at 0x101f79f50&gt;}
&gt;&gt;&gt; DHset == DHset2
False
</code></pre>
<p>There we go. By removing it from the set, we made the set forget about its
hash, so it had to be recomputed when we added it again. This version of
<code>DHset</code> now has a <code>DH</code> with a different hash than it had before. Thinking back
to <code>set</code> being a hash table, in this <code>DHset</code>, the three <code>DH</code> objects are in
different "buckets" than they were in before. <code>DHset.__eq__(DHset2)</code> notices
that the bucket structure is different right away and returns <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>By the way, what hash value are we up to these days?</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(DH)
9
</code></pre>
<h3>Example 3: When <code>a == b</code> does not imply <code>hash(a) == hash(b)</code>
</h3>
<p>Now let's look at point 2. What happens if we create an object with <code>__eq__</code>
that disagrees with <code>__hash__</code>. For Python 2, we already have made a class like
this, the <code>AlwaysEqual</code> object above. Instances of <code>AlwaysEqual</code> will always
compare equal to one another, but they will not have the same hash, because
they will use <code>object</code>'s default <code>__hash__</code> of <code>id</code>. For Python 3, however,
<code>AlwaysEqual</code> is automatically set as unhashable because we overrode <code>__eq__</code>
without also overriding <code>__hash__</code>.</p>
<p>This blog post originally used the <code>AE1</code> and <code>AE2</code> objects we created above
for the next example, but to make it work in both Python 2 and 3, let's create
a custom <code>AlwaysEqual</code> subclass that is hashable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; class AlwaysEqualHashable(AlwaysEqual):
...     def __hash__(self):
...         return id(self)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; AE1 = AlwaysEqualHashable()
&gt;&gt;&gt; AE2 = AlwaysEqualHashable()
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(AE1)
270498221
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(AE2)
270498197
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(AE1) == hash(AE2)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; AE1 == AE2
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; {AE1, AE2}
{&lt;__main__.AlwaysEqualHashable at 0x101f79950&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.AlwaysEqualHashable at 0x101f79ad0&gt;}
</code></pre>
<p>We can already see that we have broken one of the key properties of a <code>set</code>,
which is that it does not contain the same object twice (remember that <code>AE1</code>
and <code>AE2</code> should be considered the "same object" because <code>AE1 == AE2</code> is
<code>True</code>).</p>
<p>This can lead to subtle issues. For example, suppose we had a list and we
wanted to remove all the duplicate items from it. An easy way to do this is to
convert the list to a set and then convert it back to a list.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ['a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'c', 'b']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(set(l))
['a', 'b', 'c']
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this method is obviously not going to work for a list of <code>AlwaysEqualHashable</code> objects.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; AE3 = AlwaysEqualHashable()
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [AE1, AE1, AE3, AE2, AE3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(set(l))
[&lt;__main__.AlwaysEqualHashable at 0x102c1d590&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.AlwaysEqualHashable at 0x101f79ad0&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.AlwaysEqualHashable at 0x101f79950&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, what happened here is that the equality that we defined on
<code>AlwaysEqual</code> was essentially ignored. We got a list of unique items by <code>id</code>,
instead of by <code>__eq__</code>. You can imagine that if <code>__eq__</code> were something a
little less trivial, where some, but not all, objects are considered equal,
that this could lead to very subtle issues.</p>
<p>But there is an issue with the above algorithm. It isn't stable, that is, it
removes the ordering that we had on the list. We could do this better by
making a new list, and looping through the old one, adding elements to the new
list if they aren't already there.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; def uniq(l):
...     newl = []
...     for i in l:
...         if i not in newl:
...             newl.append(i)
...     return newl
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniq(['a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'c', 'b'])
['a', 'c', 'b']
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniq([AE1, AE1, AE3, AE2, AE3])
[&lt;__main__.AlwaysEqualHashable at 0x101f79ad0&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>This time, we used <code>in</code>, which uses <code>==</code>, so we got only one unique element of
the list of <code>AlwaysEqual</code> objects.</p>
<p>But there is an issue with this algorithm as well. Checking if something is in
a list is \(O(n)\), but we have an object that allows checking in \(O(1)\)
time, namely, a <code>set</code>. So a more efficient version might be to create a set
alongside the new list for containment checking purposes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; def uniq2(l):
...     newl = []
...     newlset = set()
...     for i in l:
...         if i not in newlset:
...             newl.append(i)
...             newlset.add(i)
...     return newl
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniq2(['a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'c', 'b'])
['a', 'c', 'b']
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniq2([AE1, AE1, AE3, AE2, AE3])
[&lt;__main__.AlwaysEqualHashable at 0x101f79ad0&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.AlwaysEqualHashable at 0x102c1d590&gt;,
 &lt;__main__.AlwaysEqualHashable at 0x101f79950&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>Bah! Since we used a set, we compared by hashing, not equality, so we are left
with three objects again. Notice the extremely subtle difference
here. Basically, it is this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; AE1 in {AE2}
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; AE1 in [AE2]
True
</code></pre>
<p>Set containment uses hashing; list containment uses equality. If the two don't
agree, then the result of your algorithm will depend on which one you use!</p>
<p>By the way, as you might expect, dictionary containment also uses hashing, and
tuple containment uses equality:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; AE1 in {AE2: 42}
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; AE1 in (AE2,)
True
</code></pre>
<h3>Example 4: Caching hashing</h3>
<p>If you ever want to add subtle bizarreness to a system, add some sort of
caching, and then do it wrong.</p>
<p>As we noted in the beginning, one important property of a hash function is
that it is quick to compute. A nice way to achieve this for heavily cached
objects is to cache the value of the cache on the object, so that it only
needs to be computed once. The pattern (which is modeled after SymPy's
<code>Basic</code>) is something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; class HashCache(object):
...     def __init__(self, arg):
...         self.arg = arg
...         self.hash_cache = None
...     def __hash__(self):
...         if self.hash_cache is None:
...             self.hash_cache = hash(self.arg)
...         return self.hash_cache
...     def __eq__(self, other):
...         if not isinstance(other, HashCache):
...             return False
...         return self.arg == other.arg
...
</code></pre>
<p><code>HashCache</code> is nothing more than a small wrapper around a hashable argument,
which caches its hash.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; hash('a')
12416037344
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = HashCache('a')
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(a)
12416037344
</code></pre>
<p>For ordinary Python builtins, simply recomputing the hash will be faster than
the attribute lookup used by <code>HashCache</code>. <em>Note: This uses the <code>%timeit</code> magic
from IPython. <code>%timeit</code> only works when run in IPython or Jupyter.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit hash('a')
10000000 loops, best of 3: 69.9 ns per loop
&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit hash(a)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 328 ns per loop
</code></pre>
<p>But for a custom object, computing the hash may be more computationally
expensive. As hashing is supposed to agree with equality (as I hope you've
realized by now!), if computing equality is expensive, computing a hash
function that agrees with it might be expensive as well.</p>
<p>As a simple example of where this might be useful, consider a highly nested
tuple, an object whose hash that is relatively expensive to compute.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1000):
...     a = (a,)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; A = HashCache(a)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit hash(a)
100000 loops, best of 3: 9.61 Âµs per loop
&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit hash(A)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 325 ns per loop
</code></pre>
<p>So far, we haven't done anything wrong. <code>HashCache</code>, as you may have noticed,
has <code>__eq__</code> defined correctly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; HashCache(1) == HashCache(2)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; HashCache(1) == HashCache(1)
True
</code></pre>
<p>But what happens if we mutate a <code>HashCache</code>. This is different from examples 1
and 2 above, because we will be mutating what happens with equality testing,
but not the hash (because of the cache).</p>
<p><em>In the below example, recall that small integers hash to themselves, so
<code>hash(1) == 1</code> and <code>hash(2) == 2</code>.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = HashCache(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {a: 42}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.arg = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(a)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[a]
42
</code></pre>
<p>Because we cached the hash of <code>a</code>, which was computed as soon as we created
the dictionary <code>d</code>, it remained unchanged when modified the arg to be
<code>2</code>. Thus, we can still find the key of the dictionary. But since we have
mutated <code>a</code>, the equality testing on it has changed. This means that, as with
the previous example, we are going to have issues with dicts and sets keeping
unique keys and entries (respectively).</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = HashCache(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = HashCache(2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(a)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(b)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.arg = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(a) == hash(b)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; {a, b}
{&lt;__main__.HashCache at 0x102c32050&gt;, &lt;__main__.HashCache at 0x102c32450&gt;}
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniq([a, b])
[&lt;__main__.HashCache at 0x102c32050&gt;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniq2([a, b])
[&lt;__main__.HashCache at 0x102c32050&gt;, &lt;__main__.HashCache at 0x102c32450&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>Once we mutate <code>b</code> so that it compares equal to <code>a</code>, we start to have the same sort of issues that we had in example 3 with <code>AlwaysEqualHashable</code>. Let's look at an instant replay.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = HashCache(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = HashCache(2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.arg = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(a == b)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hash(a) == hash(b))
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; print({a, b})
{&lt;__main__.HashCache object at 0x102c32a10&gt;}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(uniq([a, b]))
[&lt;__main__.HashCache object at 0x102c32a50&gt;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(uniq2([a, b]))
[&lt;__main__.HashCache object at 0x102c32a50&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>Wait a minute, this time it's different! Comparing it to above, it's pretty
easy to see what was different this time. We left out the part where we showed
the hash of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. When we did that the first time, it cached the hash
of <code>b</code>, making it forever be <code>2</code>, but when we didn't do it the second time,
the hash had not been cached yet, so the first time it is computed (in the
<code>print(hash(a) == hash(b))</code> line), <code>b.arg</code> has already been changed to <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>And herein lies the extreme subtlety: if you mutate an object with that hashes
its cache like this, you will run into issues <strong>only if</strong> you had already
called some function that hashed the object somewhere. Now just about anything
might compute the hash of an object. Or it might not. For example, our <code>uniq2</code>
function computes the hash of the objects in its input list, because it stores
them in a set, but <code>uniq</code> does not:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = HashCache(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = HashCache(2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniq2([a, b])
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.arg = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(a == b)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hash(a) == hash(b))
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; print({a, b})
{&lt;__main__.HashCache object at 0x102c32c50&gt;, &lt;__main__.HashCache object at 0x102c32c10&gt;}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(uniq([a, b]))
[&lt;__main__.HashCache object at 0x102c32c50&gt;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(uniq2([a, b]))

<p>The moral of this final example is that if you are going to cache something,
that something had better be immutable.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The conclusion is this: don't mess with hashing. The two invariants above are
important. Let's restate them here,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The hash of an object must not change across the object's lifetime (in
other words, a hashable object should be immutable).</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>a == b</code> implies <code>hash(a) == hash(b)</code> (note that the reverse might not
hold in the case of a hash collision).</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't follow these rules, you will run into very subtle issues, because
very basic Python operations expect these invariants.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to mutate an object's properties, you have two
options. First, make the object unhashable (set <code>__hash__ = None</code>). You won't
be able to use it in sets or as keys to a dictionary, but you will be free to
change the object in-place however you want.</p>
<p>A second option is to make all mutable properties non-dependent on hashing or
equality testing. This option works well if you just want to cache some
internal state that doesn't inherently change the object. Both <code>__eq__</code> and
<code>__hash__</code> should remain unchanged by changes to this state. You may also want
to make sure you use proper getters and setters to prevent modification of
internal state that equality testing and hashing does depend on.</p>
<p>If you choose this second option, however, be aware that Python considers it
fair game to swap out two identical immutable (i.e., hashable) objects at any
time. If <code>a == b</code> and <code>a</code> is hashable, Python (and Python libraries) are free
to replace <code>a</code> with <code>b</code> anywhere. For example, Python uses an optimization on
strings called <em>interning</em>, where common strings are stored only once in
memory. A similar optimization is used in CPython for small integers. If store
something on <code>a</code> but not <code>b</code> and make <code>a</code>'s hash ignore that data, you may
find that some function that should return <code>a</code> may actually return <code>b</code>. For
this reason, I generally don't recommend this second option unless you know
what you are doing.</p>
<p>Finally, to keep invariant 2, here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure that the parts of the object that you use to compare equality are
not themselves mutable. If they are, then your object cannot itself be
immutable. This means that if <code>a == b</code> depends on <code>a.attr == b.attr</code>, and
<code>a.attr</code> is a list, then you will need to use a tuple instead (if you want
<code>a</code> to be hashable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't have to invent a hash function. If you find yourself doing
bitshifts and XORs, you're doing it wrong. Reuse Python's builtin hashable
objects. If the hash of your object should depend on the hash of <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code>, define <code>__hash__</code> to return <code>hash((a, b))</code>. If the order of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
does not matter, use <code>hash(frozenset([a, b]))</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't cache something unless you know that the entire cached state will not
be changed over the lifetime of the cache. Hashable objects are actually
great for caches. If they properly satisfy invariant 1, and all the state
that should be cached is part of the hash, then you will not need to
worry. And the best part is that you can just use <code>dict</code> for your cache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless you really need the performance or memory gains, don't make your
objects mutable. This makes programs much harder to reason about. Some
functional programming languages take this idea so far that they don't allow
any mutable objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't worry about the situation where <code>hash(a) == hash(b)</code> but <code>a != b</code>. This is a hash collision. Unlike the issues we looked at here, hash
collisions are expected and checked for in Python. For example, our
<code>HashToOne</code> object from the beginning will always hash to 1, but different
instances will compare unequal. We can see that the right thing is done in
every case with them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = HashToOne()
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = HashToOne()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(a) == hash(b)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; {a, b}
{&lt;__main__.HashToOne at 0x102c32a10&gt;, &lt;__main__.HashToOne at 0x102c32cd0&gt;}
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniq([a, b])
[&lt;__main__.HashToOne at 0x102c32cd0&gt;, &lt;__main__.HashToOne at 0x102c32a10&gt;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; uniq2([a, b])
[&lt;__main__.HashToOne at 0x102c32cd0&gt;, &lt;__main__.HashToOne at 0x102c32a10&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>The only concern with hash collisions is that too many of them can remove
the performance gains of <code>dict</code> and <code>set</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conversely, if you are writing something that uses an object's hash, remember
that hash collisions are possible and unavoidable.</p>
<p>A classic example of a hash collision is <code>-1</code> and <code>-2</code>. Remember I
mentioned above that small integers hash to themselves:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(1)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(-3)
-3
</code></pre>
<p>The exception to this is <code>-1</code>. The CPython interpreter uses <code>-1</code> as an error
state, so -1 is not a valid hash value. Hence, <code>hash(-1)</code> can't be <code>-1</code>. So
the Python developers picked the next closest thing.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(-1)
-2
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(-2)
-2
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to check if something handles hash collisions correctly, this is
a simple example.  I should also note that the fact that integers hash to
themselves is an implementation detail of CPython that may not be true in
alternate Python implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we didn't discuss this much here, but don't assume that the hash of
your object will be the same across Python sessions. In Python 3.3 and up,
hash values of strings are randomized from a value that is seeded when
Python starts up. This also affects any object whose hash is computed
from the hash of strings. In Python 2.7, you can enable hash randomization
with the <code>-R</code> flag to the interpreter. The following are two different
Python sessions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hash('a'))
-7750608935454338104
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hash('a'))
8897161376854729812
