<html><body><p>So for the first time this summer, I missed my blogging deadline.  I have been on vacation for the past few weeks, and have spent a good bit of the last week in the car, driving home. But that's not my excuse.  I was on vacation the week before, when I wrote up my <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/the-risch-algorithm-part-1/">lengthy blog post on the Risch Algorithm</a>.  My excuse is that I wanted to finish up my <code>integrate_hyperexponential()</code> function before I posted, so I could write about it.  Well, I finished it on Thursday (today is Sunday, the post was due Friday), but I ran into unexpected bugs (imagine that) that has postponed it actually working until now. I also ended up doing API changes 3 different times (they are basically incrementally all one change, from supporting only one extension to properly supporting multiple extensions.  Look for long commits in my recent commit history in my branch if you are interested).  


So here is the function.  It integrates exponential functions.  You still have to manually create the differential extension, as before.  Here are some examples.  You can try them in my <a href="http://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/tree/integration2">integration2</a> branch (I have rebased over Mateusz's latest polys9update.  The latest branch is always integration<code>n</code>, where <code>n</code> is the largest integer available).

We have to manually build up the differential extension (<code>[7]</code>).  The first element is $latex x$, which is already there.  Next, we add $latex t_1 = \tan{x}$, and finally $latex t = e^{\tan{x}} = e^{t_1}$.  The third argument of <code>integrate_hyperexponential()</code> is what gives these variables their identities: their derivatives.  The fourth argument is the list of the extension symbols, and the last argument is a list of the functions for which the symbols stand for, in reverse order (because we have to back substitute in the solution in reverse order).  



The unevaluated Integral in the solution is due to the recursive nature of the Risch algorithm.  Eventually, an outer function in the algorithm will recursively integrate until it reaches the ground field, $latex \mathbb{Q}$.  It will also do the proper preparsing automatically as well.  The second element of the solution, <code>True</code>, indicates that the integral is elementary, and thus the given solution is the complete integral of the original integrand, which we can see ($latex \int (1 + \tan^2{x})dx=\tan{x}$).  



Another example:



[code language="py"]



In [1]: from sympy.integrals.risch import *



In [2]: var('t')

Out[2]: (t,)



In [3]: rd = exp(-x**2)



In [4]: rd

Out[4]: 
   2
 -x 
ℯ   



In [5]: a, d = map(lambda i: Poly(i, t), rd.subs(exp(x**2), t).as_numer_denom())



In [6]: a

Out[6]: Poly(1, t, domain='ZZ')



In [7]: d

Out[7]: Poly(t, t, domain='ZZ')



In [8]: integrate_hyperexponential(a, d, [Poly(1, x), Poly(2*x*t, t)], [x, t], [lambda x: exp(x**2)])



Out[8]: (0, False)



[/code]



Here the second argument of the solution is <code>False</code>, which indicates that the algorithm has proven that the integral of $latex e^{-x^2}$ is not elementary!   The first argument 0 indicates that actually it is the integral of $latex e^{-x^2} - \frac{d}{dx}(0)$ that is not elementary, i.e., the Risch algorithm will reduce an integrand into an integrated function part and non-elementary part.  For example:



[code language="py"]

In [1]: from sympy.integrals.risch import *



In [2]: var('t1, t')

Out[2]: (t₁, t)



In [3]: rd = exp(x)/tan(x) + exp(x)/(1 + exp(x))



In [4]: rd

Out[4]: 
   x        x  
  ℯ        ℯ   
────── + ──────
     x   tan(x)
1 + ℯ          



In [5]: a, d = map(lambda i: Poly(i, t), rd.subs(exp(x), t).subs(tan(x), t1).as_numer_denom())



In [6]: a

Out[6]: Poly(t**2 + (1 + t1)*t, t, domain='ZZ[t1]')



In [7]: d

Out[7]: Poly(t1*t + t1, t, domain='ZZ[t1]')



In [8]: integrate_hyperexponential(a, d, [Poly(1, x), Poly(1 + t1**2, t1), Poly(t, t)], [x, t1, t], [exp, tan])

Out[8]: 

⎛   ⎛     x⎞       ⎞

⎝log⎝1 + ℯ ⎠, False⎠



[/code]



This indicates that the integral of $latex (\frac{e^x}{\tan{x}} + \frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}) - \frac{d}{dx}(\log{(1 + e^x)}) = \frac{e^x}{\tan{x}}$ is not elementary.  That is one advantage that the new algorithm will have over the present one.  Currently, the present algorithm just returns an unevaluated Integral for the above <code>rd</code>, but the new one will be able to return $latex \log{(1 + e^x)} + \int{\frac{e^x}{\tan{x}}dx}$.  It will be able to do this even if rd were rewritten as $latex \frac{e^x \tan{x} + e^x + e^{2x}}{e^x \tan{x} + \tan{x}}$ (notice that this is exactly what <code>.as_numer_denom()</code> is doing anyway in <code>[5]</code>, as you can see in <code>[6]</code> and <code>[7]</code>).  Furthermore, it will have actually <em>proven</em> that the remaining $latex \int{\frac{e^x}{\tan{x}}dx}$ is non-elementary.  I plan on having some kind of marker in the pretty printed unevaluated <code>Integral</code> to indicate this.  Suggestions on what this should be are welcome.  



Finally, the full algorithm appears to be faster (probably asymptotically faster) than the current implementation:



[code language="py"]

In [1]: from sympy.integrals.risch import *



In [2]: var('t1, t')

Out[2]: (t₁, t)



In [3]: rd = exp(x)*x**4



In [4]: a, d = map(lambda i: Poly(i, t), rd.subs(exp(x), t).as_numer_denom())



In [5]: integrate_hyperexponential(a, d, [Poly(1, x), Poly(t, t)], [x, t], [lambda x: exp(x)])

Out[5]: 

⎛    x    4  x         x      3  x       2  x      ⎞

⎝24⋅ℯ  + x ⋅ℯ  - 24⋅x⋅ℯ  - 4⋅x ⋅ℯ  + 12⋅x ⋅ℯ , True⎠



In [6]: %timeit integrate_hyperexponential(a, d, [Poly(1, x), Poly(t, t)], [x, t], [exp])

10 loops, best of 3: 28 ms per loop



In [7]: integrate(rd, x)

Out[7]: 
    x    4  x         x      3  x       2  x

[/code]



Of course, keep in mind that I am timing what will be an internal function against a full function.  But if you increase the exponent on x, you find that there is no way the addition of preparsing time (which shouldn't be affected by such a change) will cause it to become as slow as the current <code>integrate()</code>.  Like I said, I am pretty sure that it is asymptotic.  For example:



[code language="py"]

In [1]: from sympy.integrals.risch import *



In [2]: var('t1, t')

Out[2]: (t₁, t)



In [3]: rd = exp(x)*x**10

There is one thing I should mention.  I haven't implemented all the cases in <code>rischDE()</code>, which is the subproblem for exponential functions (more on this in a future "The Risch Algorithm" post).  So some integrals will fail with a <code>NotImplementedError</code>, indicating that there is a function that I still need to implement to solve the integral:



[code language="py"]

In [1]: from sympy.integrals.risch import *



In [2]: var('t1, t')

Out[2]: (t₁, t)



In [3]: rd = (exp(x) - x*exp(2*x)*tan(x))/tan(x)



In [4]: a, d = map(lambda i: Poly(i, t), rd.subs(exp(x), t).subs(tan(x), t1).as_numer_denom())



In [5]: a

Out[5]: Poly(-t1*x*t**2 + t, t, domain='ZZ[x,t1]')



In [6]: d

Out[6]: Poly(t1, t, domain='ZZ[t1]')



In [7]: integrate_hyperexponential(a, d, [Poly(1, x), Poly(1 + t1**2, t1), Poly(t, t)], [x, t1, t], [exp, tan])

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

...

NotImplementedError: The ability to solve the parametric logarithmic derivative problem is required to solve this RDE

[/code]



So feel free to give this a try and let me know what you think.  You will have to do the preparsing as I have done above, which means that you also have to be careful that any extension that you make is not the derivative or logarithmic derivative of an element of the field you have already built up.  You also cannot use algebraic functions, as I mentioned before, including things like $latex e^\frac{\log{x}}{2}$ (functions like these are called the logarithmic derivatives of k(t)-radicals, which I will also discuss in a future "The Risch Algorithm" post).  If you just use simple extensions like <code>t1 = tan(x);t=exp(x)</code> like I have above, you won't need to worry about this.  Each derivative Poly should be in the variable that it is the derivative of (e.g., start with <code>Poly(1, x)</code>, then add <code>Poly(1 + t1**2, t1)</code>, <code>Poly(t2*(1 + t1**2), t2)</code>, etc.).  Everything else should be a Poly in <code>t</code>, the last element of the extension.  And in cause you didn't get it, the last extension must be an exponential function.  



Also, I didn't have to do it in any of the above examples, but the first and second arguments to <code>integrate_hyperexponential()</code> <em>must</em> be canceled (<code>a, d = a.cancel(d, include=True)</code> will do this for you), or you will get a wrong result!  I spent a good day of debugging until I figured this out.  The existence of other bugs didn't help.</p></body></html>
