Join me in congratulating these students on their acceptance.   

In case you don't know for some reason, Google Summer of Code is a program where Google pays students to write code for open source projects.  SymPy was accepted as a mentoring organization this year.  The goal of the summer is to help the students learn new skills, in particular in our case: 

* contributing to open source 

* working with the community 

* learn git, pull requests, reviews 

* teach them how to review other's people patches 

* do useful work for SymPy 

* have fun, and encourage the students to stay around
