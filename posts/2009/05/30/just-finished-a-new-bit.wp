<html><body><p>I just finished first order homogeneous equations, as well as my logcombine function, and I have pushed them to <a href="http://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/tree/odes-stable">http://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/tree/odes-stable</a>.  So expect a major blog posting about them both soon (it is midnight right now, so bedtime, maybe tomorrow).


If you are a member of the SymPy project reading this, <em>please</em>, review my patches.  I have already submitted exact equations and the logcombine function, and neither of them have made it in.  And the more reviewing that there is, the better for my code.</p></body></html>
