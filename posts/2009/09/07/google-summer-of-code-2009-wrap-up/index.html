<p>Sor­ry about the ex­treme de­lay with this.  I of course have been busy with class­es.</p> 
 <p>Note that this will just be a sum­ma­ry of the sum­mer, with my com­ments look­ing back on it.  If you want more de­tails on each in­di­vid­u­al thing that I im­ple­ment­ed, look back on my pre­vi­ous blog post­s.</p> 
 <p>Let me start from the be­gin­ning.  Around late Feb­ru­ary to ear­ly March of this year, I dis­cov­ered the ex­is­tence of Google Sum­mer of Code.  I knew that I want­ed to do some kind of work this sum­mer, prefer­ably an in­tern­ship, so it piqued my in­ter­est.  At that time, the men­tor­ing or­ga­ni­za­tions were still ap­ply­ing for GSoC 2009, so I could on­ly look at the ones from 2008.  Most of them were ei­ther Lin­ux things or Web things, nei­ther of which I had any ex­pe­ri­ence in or am I much in­ter­est­ed in.  I took a free course in Python at my Uni­ver­si­ty the pre­vi­ous semester, and it was the pro­gram­ming lan­guage that I knew best at the time.  I had learned some Ja­va in my first se­mes­ter CS class (did I men­tion that this was my first year at col­lege?), and I hat­ed it, and I was still learn­ing C for my sec­ond se­mes­ter CS class.  So I looked at what the Python Foun­da­tion had to of­fer.  I am a dou­ble ma­jor in math and com­put­er sci­ence, so I looked un­der the math­/­science head­ing.  That's when I saw SymPy.</p> 
 <p>I should not that I have been ahead in Math.  It was my sec­ond semester, and I was tak­ing Dis­crete Math­e­mat­ic­s, Or­di­nary Dif­fer­en­tial Equa­tion­s, Ba­sic Con­cepts of Math, and Vec­tor Anal­y­sis.  So I looked for project ideas on the SymPy page that re­lat­ed to what I knew.  The on­ly one that I saw, oth­er than core im­prove­ments, was to im­prove the ODE solv­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.  I got in­to con­tact with the com­mu­ni­ty and looked at the source, find­ing that it was on­ly ca­pa­ble of solv­ing 1st or­der lin­ear equa­tions and some spe­cial cas­es of 2nd or­der lin­ear ho­mo­ge­neous equa­tions with con­stant co­ef­fi­cients.  I al­ready at that point knew sev­er­al meth­ods from my ODE course, and I knew much of what I would learn.   </p> 
 <p><strong>Ap­pli­ca­tion Pe­ri­od</strong></p> 
 <p>The most dif­fi­cult part of the Google Sum­mer of Code, in my opin­ion, is the ap­pli­ca­tion pe­ri­od.  For starter­s, you have to do it while you are still in class­es, so you pret­ty much have to do it in your free time.  Al­so, if you have nev­er ap­plied for Google Sum­mer of Code be­fore, you do not re­al­ly know what a good ap­pli­ca­tion should look like.  I have long had my ap­pli­ca­tion avail­able on the  <a href="http://wiki.sympy.org/wiki/User:Asmeurer/GSoC2009_Application">SymPy Wi­ki</a>, and I will ref­er­ence it here a few times.  First of­f, it was rec­om­mend­ed to me by some of the SymPy de­vel­op­ers that I put as many po­ten­tial things that I could do in the sum­mer in my ap­pli­ca­tion as I though I could do.  I was still on­ly about half way through my ODEs course when I wrote the ap­pli­ca­tion, but I had the syl­labus so I knew the meth­ods I would be learn­ing at least by name.  So that is ex­act­ly what I did:  I packed my ap­pli­ca­tion with ev­ery pos­si­ble thing that I knew we would be learn­ing about in ODEs.   </p> 
 <p>Af­ter I felt that I had a strong ap­pli­ca­tion, and On­drej had proof­read it for me, I sub­mit­ted it.  There were ac­tu­al­ly two iden­ti­cal ap­pli­ca­tion­s, one for the Python Soft­ware Foun­da­tion, and one for Port­land State Uni­ver­si­ty.  This is be­cause SymPy was not ac­cept­ed as a men­tor­ing or­ga­ni­za­tion di­rect­ly, so they had to use those two foun­da­tions as prox­ies.  A re­quire­ment of ac­cep­tance is to sub­mit a patch that pass­es re­view.  I de­cid­ed to add a Bernoul­li solver, be­cause Bernoul­li can be solved in the gen­er­al case much like the 1st or­der lin­ear ODE, which was al­ready im­ple­ment­ed.   </p> 
 <p>Af­ter I ap­plied, there was an ac­cep­tance pe­ri­od.  I used that pe­ri­od to be­come aquat­int­ed with the SymPy com­mu­ni­ty and code base.  A good way to do this is to try to fix  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list?q=label:EasyToFix">EasyToFix is­sues</a>.  I found  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=694">is­sue 694</a>, which is to im­ple­ment a bunch of tests from a pa­per by Michael West­er for test­ing com­put­er al­ge­bra sys­tem­s.  The tests cov­er ev­ery pos­si­ble thing that a full fea­tured CAS could do, so it was a great way to learn SymPy.  The is­sue is still un­fin­ished, so work­ing on it is still a good way to learn how to use SymPy.   </p> 
 <p>Al­so, it was im­por­tant to learn git, SymPy's ver­sion con­trol sys­tem.  The learn­ing curve it pret­ty steep if you have nev­er used ver­sion con­trol sys­tem be­fore, but once you can use it, it be­comes a great tool at your dis­pos­al.   </p> 
 <p><strong>Ac­cep­tance</strong></p> 
 <p>Af­ter be­ing ac­cept­ed, I toned down my work with SymPy to work on fin­ish­ing up my class­es.  My class­es fin­ished a few weeks be­fore the of­fi­cial start, so I used that pe­ri­od to get a jump start on my projec­t.</p> 
 <p><strong>The GSoC Pe­ri­od</strong></p> 
 <p>For the start of the pe­ri­od, I fol­lowed my time­line.  I im­ple­ment­ed 1st or­der ODEs with ho­mo­ge­neous co­ef­fi­cients and 1st or­der ex­act ODEs.  These were both pret­ty sim­ple to do, as I ex­pect­ed.   </p> 
 <p>The next thing I want­ed to do was sep­a­ra­ble.  My goal at this point was to get ev­ery rel­e­vant ex­er­cise from my text­book to work with my solver­s.  One of the ex­er­cis­es from my  <a href="http://books.google.com.np/books?id=29utVed7QMIC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;ots=uxLSUKt_3P&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">book</a>  (Pg. 56, No. 21) was $la­tex dy=e^{x + y}dx$.  I soon dis­cov­ered that it was im­pos­si­ble for SymPy to sep­a­rate $la­tex e^{x + y} \rightar­row e^{x}e^{y}$, be­cause the sec­ond would be au­to­mat­i­cal­ly com­bined in the core.  I al­so dis­cov­ered that  <code>ex­pand()</code>, which should have been the func­tion to split that, ex­pand­ed us­ing all pos­si­ble meth­ods in­dis­crim­i­nate­ly.  Part of my  <code>sep­a­rat­e­vars()</code>  func­tion that I was writ­ing to sep­a­rate vari­ables in ex­pres­sions would be to split things like $la­tex x + yx \rightar­row x(1 + y)$ and $la­tex 2 x y + x^{2} + y^{2} \rightar­row (x + y)^{2}$, but  <code>ex­pand()</code></p> 
 <p>as it was cur­rent­ly writ­ten would ex­pand those.   </p> 
 <p>So I spent a few weeks hack­ing on the core to make it not au­to-­com­bine ex­po­nents.  I came up with a rule that ex­po­nents would on­ly au­to-­com­bine if they had the same term mi­nus the co­ef­fi­cien­t, the same rule that  <code>Add</code>  us­es to de­ter­mine what terms should au­to com­bined by ad­di­tion.  So it would com­bine $la­tex e^{x}e^{x} \rightar­row e^{2x}$, but $la­tex e^{x}e^{y}$ would be left alone.  It turns out that some of our al­go­rithm­s, name­ly the Gruntz lim­it al­go­rith­m, re­lies on au­to-­com­bin­ing.  We al­ready had a func­tion that could com­bine ex­po­nents,  <code>powsim­p()</code>, but it al­so com­bined bases, as in $la­tex x^zy^z \rightar­row (xy)^z$, so I had to split the be­hav­ior so that it could act on­ly as au­to-­com­bin­ing once did (by the way, use  <code>powsim­p(­ex­pr, com­bine='­ex­p', deep­=True)</code>  to do this).  Then, af­ter some help from On­drej on pin­point­ing the ex­act lo­ca­tion of the bugs, I just ap­plied the func­tion there.  The last thing I did here was to split the be­hav­ior of ex­pand, so that you could do  <code>ex­pand(x<em>(y + 1), mul=­False)</em></code>  and it would leave it alone, but  <code>ex­pand(­ex­p(x + y), mul=­False)</code>  would re­turn  <code>ex­p(x)­ex­p(y)</code>.  This split be­hav­ior turned out to be use­ful in more than one place in my code.   </p> 
 <p>This was the first non bug fix patch of mine that was pushed in to SymPy, and at the time of this writ­ing, it is the last ma­jor one in the lat­est sta­ble ver­sion.  It took some ma­jor re­bas­ing to get my con­vo­lut­ed com­mit his­to­ry ready for sub­mis­sion, and it was dur­ing this phase that I git fi­nal­ly clicked for me, es­pe­cial the  <code>git re­base</code>  com­mand.  This work took a few weeks from my ODEs time, and it be­came clear that I would not be do­ing ev­ery pos­si­ble thing from my ap­pli­ca­tion.  The rea­son that I in­clud­ed so much in my ap­pli­ca­tion was that my project was non-atom­ic.  I could im­ple­ment a lit­tle or a lot and still have a work­ing  use­ful mod­ule.   </p> 
 <p>If you look at my time­line on my ap­pli­ca­tion, you can see that the first half is sym­bol­ic meth­od­s, and the sec­ond half is oth­er meth­od­s, things like se­ries.  It turns out that we did­n't re­al­ly learn much about sys­tems of ODEs in my course and we learned very lit­tle about nu­mer­i­cal meth­ods (and it would take much more to know how to im­ple­ment them).  We did learn se­ries meth­od­s, but they were so an­noy­ing to do that I came to hate them with a pas­sion.  So I de­cid­ed to just fo­cus on sym­bol­ic meth­od­s, which were my fa­vorite any­way.  My goal was to im­ple­ment as many as I could.   </p> 
 <p>Af­ter I fin­ished up sep­a­ra­ble equa­tion­s, I came up with an idea that I did not have dur­ing the ap­pli­ca­tion pe­ri­od.  <code>dsolve()</code>  was be­com­ing clut­tered fast with all of my so­lu­tion meth­od­s.  The way that it worked was that it took an ODE and it tried to match meth­ods one by one un­til it found one that worked, which it then used.   This had some draw­back­s.  First, as I men­tioned, the code was very clut­tered.  Sec­ond, the ODEs meth­ods would have to be ap­plied in a pre­de­ter­mined or­der.  There are sev­er­al ODEs that match more than one method.  For ex­am­ple, $la­tex 2xy + (x^2 + y^2)\frac{dy}{dx}=0$ has co­ef­fi­cients that are both ho­mo­ge­neous of or­der 2, and is al­so ex­ac­t, so it can be solved by ei­ther method.  The two solvers re­turn dif­fer­ent­ly for­mat­ted so­lu­tions for each one.  A sim­pler ex­am­ple is that 1st or­der ODEs with ho­mo­ge­neous co­ef­fi­cients can be solved in two dif­fer­ent ways.  My work­ing so­lu­tion was to try them both and then ap­ply some heuris­tics to re­turn the sim­plest one.  But some­times, one way would cre­ate an im­pos­si­ble in­te­gral that would hand the in­te­gra­tion en­gine.  And it made de­bug­ging the two solvers more dif­fi­cult be­cause I had to over­ride my heuris­tic.  This al­so touch­es on the third point.  Some­times the so­lu­tion to an ODE can on­ly be rep­re­sent­ed in the form of an un­eval­u­at­able in­te­gral. SymPy's  <code>in­te­grate()</code>  func­tion is sup­posed to re­turn an un­eval­u­at­ed  <code>In­te­gral</code>  class if it can­not do it, but all too of­ten it will just hang for­ev­er.   </p> 
 <p>The so­lu­tion I came up with was to re­write dsolve us­ing a hints method.  I would cre­ate a new func­tion called  <code>clas­si­fy_ode()</code>  that would do all of the ODE clas­si­fi­ca­tion, re­mov­ing it from the solv­ing code.  By de­fault, dsolve would still use a pre­de­ter­mined or­der of match­ing meth­od­s.  But you could over­ride it by pass­ing a "hin­t" to  <code>dsolve</code>  for any match­ing method, and it would ap­ply that method.  There would al­so be op­tions to on­ly re­turn un­eval­u­at­ed in­te­grals when ap­pli­ca­ble.   </p> 
 <p>I end­ed up do­ing this and more (see the doc­strings for  <code>clas­si­fy_ode()</code>  and  <code>dsolve()</code>  in the cur­rent git mas­ter branch), but be­fore I could I need­ed to clean up some things.  I need­ed to re­write all of  <code>dsolve()</code>  and re­lat­ed func­tion­s.  Be­fore I start­ed the pro­gram, there were some spe­cial cas­es in dsolve for sec­ond or­der lin­ear ho­mo­ge­neous ODEs with con­stant co­ef­fi­cients and one very spe­cial case ODE for the ex­pand­ed form of $la­tex \frac{d^2}{dx^2}(x­e^{-y}) = 0$.   </p> 
 <p>So the first thing I did was im­ple­ment a solver for the gen­er­al ho­mo­ge­neous lin­ear with con­stant co­ef­fi­cients case.  These are rather sim­ple to do: you just find the roots of the char­ac­ter­is­tic poly­no­mi­al built off of the co­ef­fi­cients, and then put the re­al parts of the roots in front of the ar­gu­ment of an ex­po­nen­tial and the imag­i­nary parts in front of the ar­gu­ments of a sine and co­sine (for ex­am­ple, $la­tex 3 \pm 2i$ would give $la­tex C1e^{3x}\s­in{2x} + C2e^{3x}\­cos{2x}$.  The thing was, that if the imag­i­nary part is 0, then you on­ly have 1 ar­bi­trary con­stant on the ex­po­nen­tial, but if it is non-ze­ro, you get 2, one for each trig func­tion.  The rest falls out nice­ly if you plug 0 in for $la­tex b$ in­to $e^{ax}(C1\s­in{bx} + C2\­cos{box})$ be­cause the sine goes to 0 and the co­sine be­comes 1.  But you would end up with $la­tex C1 + C2$ in­stead of just $la­tex C1$ in that case.  I had al­ready planned on do­ing ar­bi­trary con­stant sim­pli­fi­ca­tion as part of my pro­jec­t, so I fig­ured I would put this on hold and do that first.  Then, once that was done, the ho­mo­ge­neous case would be re­duced to 1 case in­stead of the usu­al 2 or 3.   </p> 
 <p>My orig­i­nal plan was to make an ar­bi­trary con­stant type that au­to­mat­i­cal­ly sim­pli­fied it­self.  So, for ex­am­ple, if you en­tered  <code>C1 + 2 + x</code>  with  <code>C1</code>  an ar­bi­trary con­stan­t, it would re­duce to just  <code>C1 + x</code>.  I worked with On­drej, in­clud­ing vis­it­ing him in Los Alam­os, and we build up a class that worked.  The prob­lem was that, in or­der to have au­to-sim­pli­fi­ca­tion, I had to write the sim­pli­fi­ca­tion di­rect­ly in­to the core.  Nei­ther of us liked this, so we worked a lit­tle bit on a ba­sic core that would al­low au­to-sim­pli­fi­ca­tion to be writ­ten di­rect­ly in the class­es in­stead of in the  <code>Mul.flat­ten()</code>  and  <code>Ad­d.flat­ten()</code>  meth­od­s.  It turns out that my con­stant class is­n't the on­ly thing that would ben­e­fit from this.  Things like the or­der class (O(x)) and the in­fin­i­ty class (oo) are au­to-sim­pli­fied in the core, and things could be much clean­er if they hap­pened in the class­es them­selves.  Un­for­tu­nate­ly, mod­i­fy­ing the core like this is not some­thing that can hap­pen overnight or even in a few week­s.  For one thing, it need­ed to wait un­til we had the new as­sump­tions sys­tem, which was an­oth­er Google Sum­mer of Code project run­ning par­al­lel to my own.  So we de­cid­ed to shelf the idea.</p> 
 <p>I still want­ed con­stant sim­pli­fi­ca­tion, so I set­tled with writ­ing a func­tion that could do it in­stead.  There were some down­sides to this.  Mak­ing the func­tion as gen­er­al as the class­es might have been would have been far too much work, so I set­tled on mak­ing it an in­ter­nal-on­ly  func­tion that on­ly worked on sym­bols named  <code>C1</code>,  <code>C2</code>, etc.  Al­so, un­like writ­ing the sim­pli­fi­ca­tion straight in­to  <code>Mul.flat­ten()</code>  which was as sim­ple as re­mov­ing any terms that were not de­pen­dent on x, writ­ing a func­tion that parsed an ex­pres­sion and sim­pli­fied it was con­sid­er­ably hard­er to write.  I man­aged to churn out some­thing that worked, and so I was ready to fin­ish up the solver I had start­ed a few para­graphs ago.   </p> 
 <p>Af­ter I fin­ished that, I still need­ed to main­tain the abil­i­ty to solve that spe­cial case ODE.  Ap­par­ent­ly, it is an ODE that you would get some­where in de­riv­ing some­thing about rel­a­tiv­i­ty, be­cause it was in the rel­a­tiv­i­ty.py ex­am­ple file.  I used Maple's ex­cel­lent  <code>ode­anal­y­ser()</code>  func­tion (this is where I go the idea for my  <code>clas­si­fy_ode()</code>)to find a sim­ple gen­er­al case ODE that it fit (Liou­ville ODE).  Af­ter I fin­ished this, I was ready to start work­ing on the hints en­gine.   </p> 
 <p>It took me about a week to move all clas­si­fi­ca­tion code in­to  <code>clas­si­fy_ode()</code>, move all solvers in­to in­di­vid­u­al func­tion­s, sep­a­rate sim­pli­fi­ca­tion code in­to yet oth­er func­tion­s, and tie it all to­geth­er in  <code>dsolve()</code>.  In the end, the mod­el worked very well.  The mod­u­lar­iza­tion al­lowed me to do some oth­er things that I had not con­sid­ered, such as cre­at­ing a spe­cial "best" hint that used some heuris­tics that I orig­i­nal­ly de­vel­oped for first or­der ho­mo­ge­neous which al­ways has two pos­si­ble so­lu­tions to try to give the best for­mat­ted so­lu­tion for any ODE that has more than one pos­si­ble so­lu­tion method.  It al­so made de­bug­ging in­di­vid­u­al meth­ods much eas­ier, be­cause I could just use the built in hint calls in  <code>dsolve()</code>  in­stead of com­ment­ing out lines of code in the source.   </p> 
 <p>This was good, be­cause there was one more method that I want­ed to im­ple­men­t.  I want­ed to be able to solve the in­ho­mo­ge­neous case of a nth or­der lin­ear ode with con­stant co­ef­fi­cients.  This can be done in the gen­er­al case us­ing the method of vari­a­tion of pa­ram­e­ter­s.  It was quite sim­ple to set up vari­a­tion of pa­ram­e­ters up in the code.  You on­ly have to set up a sys­tem of in­te­grals us­ing the Wron­skian of the gen­er­al so­lu­tion­s.  It would usu­al­ly be a very poor choice of a method if you were try­ing to solve an ODE by hand be­cause tak­ing the Wron­skian and com­put­ing n in­te­grals is a lot of work.  But for a CAS, the work is al­ready there.  I just have to set up the in­te­gral­s.   </p> 
 <p>It soon be­came clear that even though, in the­o­ry, the method of vari­a­tion of pa­ram­e­ters can solve any ODE of this type, in prac­tice, it does not al­ways work so well in SymPy.  This is be­cause SymPy have very poor sim­pli­fi­ca­tion, es­pe­cial­ly trigono­met­ric sim­pli­fi­ca­tion, so some­times there would be a trigono­met­ric Wron­skian that would be iden­ti­cal­ly equal to some con­stan­t, but it could on­ly sim­pli­fy it to some very large ra­tio­nal func­tion of sines and cosines.  When these were passed to the in­te­gral en­gine, it would cause it to fail, be­cause it could not find the in­te­gral for such a seem­ing­ly com­plex ex­pres­sion.   </p> 
 <p>In ad­di­tion, tak­ing Wron­skian­s, sim­pli­fy­ing them, and then tak­ing n in­te­grals is a lot of work as I said, and even when SymPy could do it, it took a long time.  There is an­oth­er method for solv­ing these types of equa­tions called un­de­ter­mined co­ef­fi­cients that does not re­quire in­te­gra­tion.  It on­ly works on a class of ODEs where the right hand side of the ODE is a sim­ple com­bi­na­tion of sines, cosi­nes, ex­po­nen­tial­s, and poly­no­mi­als in x.  It turns out that these kinds of func­tions are com­mon any­way, so most ODEs of this type that you would en­counter could be solved with this method.  Un­like vari­a­tion of pa­ram­e­ter­s, un­de­ter­mined co­ef­fi­cients re­quires con­sid­er­able se­tup, in­clud­ing check­ing for dif­fer­ent cas­es.  This would be the method that you would want to use if you had to solve the ODE by hand be­cause, even with all the se­tup, it on­ly re­quires solv­ing a sys­tem of lin­ear equa­tions vs. solv­ing n in­te­grals with vari­a­tion of pa­ram­e­ter­s, but for a CAS, it is the set­up that mat­ter­s, so this was a dif­fi­cult prospec­t.</p> 
 <p>I spent the last cou­ple of weeks writ­ing up the nec­es­sary al­go­rithms to set­up the re­quired sys­tem of lin­ear equa­tions and han­dling the dif­fer­ent cas­es.  Af­ter I fi­nal­ly worked out all of the bugs, I ran some pro­fil­ing against my vari­a­tion of pa­ram­e­ters solver.  It turned out that for ODEs that had trigono­met­ric so­lu­tions (which take longer to sim­pli­fy), my un­de­ter­mined co­ef­fi­cients solver was an or­der of mag­ni­tude faster than the vari­a­tion of pa­ram­e­ters solver (and that is just for the ODEs that the vari­a­tion of pa­ram­e­ters en­gine could even solve at al­l).  For ODEs that on­ly had ex­po­nen­tial­s, it was still 2-4 times faster.   </p> 
 <p>I fin­ished off the sum­mer by writ­ing ex­ten­sive doc­u­men­ta­tion for all of my solvers and func­tion­s.  Hope­ful­ly some­one who us­es SymPy to solve ODEs can learn some­thing about ODE solv­ing meth­ods as well as how to use the func­tion I wrote when they read my doc­u­men­ta­tion.  </p> 
 <p><strong>  Post-G­SoC</strong></p> 
 <p>I plan on con­tin­u­ing de­vel­op­ment with SymPy now that the Google Sum­mer of Code pe­ri­od is over.  SymPy is an amaz­ing pro­jec­t, mix­ing Python and Com­put­er Al­ge­bra, and I want to help it grow.  I may even ap­ply again in a fu­ture year to im­ple­ment some oth­er thing in SymPy, or maybe ap­ply as a men­tor for SymPy to help some­one else im­prove it.   </p> 
 <p><strong>Ad­vice</strong></p> 
 <p>What fol­lows is some gen­er­al ad­vice for some­one who wants to ap­ply for Google Sum­mer of Code.  Some of the ad­vice per­tains specif­i­cal­ly to SymPy, and some of it is gen­er­al ad­vice that I think would ap­ply to any projec­t.</p> 
 <ul>
<li> 
 <p>Get in­­­volved ear­­ly.  As soon as you de­­cide that you want to par­tic­i­­pate in Google Sum­mer of Code, start get­t­ing in­­­volved in the pro­jec­t.  Get in­­­to con­­tact with them and dis­­­cuss pos­si­ble pro­jec­t­s.  If you are look­ing be­­fore the par­tic­i­­pat­ing or­­ga­ni­za­­­tions are an­­nounced, look at the or­­ga­ni­za­­­tions from pre­vi­ous years. For some or­­ga­ni­za­­­tion­s, it will vary; for oth­­ers (like Python), it is al­­most giv­en that they will be ac­­cep­t­ed ev­ery year.     </p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>Some projects (in­­clud­ing SymPy) re­quire you to send in a patch that pass­es re­view to be ac­­cep­t­ed.  This will give you a change to start fa­mil­iar­iz­ing your­­self with the code base.  If you are ap­­ply­ing to SymPy, the West­­er ex­am­­ple I men­­tioned above is a re­al­­ly good way to learn what SymPy can do and how it work­s.    </p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>Sub­­scribe to the mail­ing list, and once you are com­­fort­able with it, par­tic­i­­pate.  Al­­so, it is a good idea to idle in IRC (SymPy is on freen­ode at #sympy).  This will help you get to know the main con­trib­u­­tors for the pro­jec­t.     </p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>For you ap­­pli­­ca­­tion, see if the peo­­ple in the project you are ap­­ply­ing for will re­view it. If they like your project idea, they will try to help you write a good ap­­pli­­ca­­tion so you can be ac­­cep­t­ed and you can im­­ple­­ment it.  If they don't like your idea, then they will tell you and you should change it, oth­­er­­wise you will not be ac­­cep­t­ed, no mat­ter how well writ­ten your pro­­pos­al is.  I have my pro­­pos­al on the wi­­ki (see link above).  I am not say­ing that it is nec­es­sar­i­­ly a very good pro­­pos­al, but it did get ac­­cep­t­ed.  If you are ap­­ply­ing to SymPy, On­­drej will proof­read your ap­­pli­­ca­­tions for you.</p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>If you are an IRC fan, there is al­­so #g­­soc on freen­ode, where you can ask all your GSoC re­lat­ed ques­­tion­s.  Be warned that it does get pret­­ty noisy in the ap­­pli­­ca­­tion pe­ri­od, es­­pe­­cial­­ly right be­­fore the ap­­pli­­ca­­tions are due and right be­­fore pro­­pos­als are ac­­cep­t­ed.    </p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>I can­not stress this one enough.  If you have nev­er worked with a ver­­sion con­trol sys­tem be­­fore, it is per­haps more im­­por­­tant to spend your time learn­ing it than it is to learn the code base for your pro­jec­t.  These things have a steep learn­ing curve if you have nev­er used them be­­fore.  Once you mas­ter them though, they can make your life much eas­i­er.  Al­­so, the soon­er you learn to use them well, the eas­i­er your life will be lat­er on down the road.  I spent a good part of the last week of GSoC clean­ing up my com­mit his­­to­ry from the first half of the sum­mer when I bad very poor com­mit­t­ing/log habit­s.  If your project us­es git, such as SymPy does, you might look at   <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn//gitmagic/">this</a>   tu­­to­ri­al.  If it us­es some­thing else, good luck.  Se­ri­ous­­ly, git is the on­­ly good ver­­sion con­trol sys­tem.  See   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">this video</a>.</p>  
  </li> 
 <li> 
 <p>Ex­pect to spend on­­ly about half of the sum­mer ac­­tu­al­­ly im­­ple­­men­t­ing stuff.  You may think that you are a good pro­­gram­mer and that your code will not be so bug­­gy that you will need to spend that much time fix­ing bugs, and you may be right.  But the fact is, you will be work­ing on code bases writ­ten by may pro­­gram­mers that are not so good.  You will need to fix sev­er­al al­ready ex­ist­ing bugs to make your code work, which means that you will need to learn the code base well, learn how to read oth­­er peo­­ple's code, and how to fix bugs that you had no part in cre­at­ing.  You will be glad if a bug is in your code be­­cause you will usu­al­­ly know im­me­di­ate­­ly what caus­es it and how to fix it.  But if a bug is some­where else, you will need to find it, fig­ure out why it hap­pen­s, what is sup­­posed to hap­pen, and how to fix it with­­out break­ing any­thing else.  This is al­­so why it is im­­por­­tant to be ac­­tive in the de­vel­op­er com­­mu­ni­­ty.    </p>

 <p>Good luck.</p>
