<p>In my  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3/">fi­nal post</a>  about my switch­ing to Emac­s, a  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3/#comment-544">com­menter</a>, Scot­t, asked me, "It has been a while since you start­ed us­ing Emac­s. I’m just cu­ri­ous. How is your ex­pe­ri­ence so far now that you have more ex­pe­ri­ence and a more com­plete con­fig­u­ra­tion?"  My re­ply was get­ting quite long, so I fig­ured it would be best suit­ed as a new post.</p> 
 <p>The short an­swer is, most­ly the same since I wrote that  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3">Vim vs. Emacs (part 3)</a>. Once you use some­thing a lot, you no­tice all kinds of things that could use im­prove­ments. Some of them are just mi­nor an­noy­ances. For ex­am­ple, many in­ter­ac­tive com­mands in Emacs (but not al­l!) re­quire you to type out "yes" in­stead of just "y" as a con­fir­ma­tion. Oth­ers are more se­ri­ous, like the need for a re­al re­place­ment of Su­perTab from vim.</p> 
 <p>I ac­tu­al­ly did­n't have much free time to work on con­fig­ur­ing Emacs dur­ing the school year, and once the sum­mer start­ed, my com­put­er died, and I've been work­ing of an old lap­top run­ning Lin­ux un­til I can get a new one. For­tu­nate­ly, I had the fore­sight to put all my Emacs con­fig­u­ra­tion  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/dotfiles">on­line on GitHub</a>, so it was easy to get my con­fig­u­ra­tion again. I've no­ticed that in Lin­ux, the Alt key (i.e., Meta) is used for oth­er things, so it does­n't work so well in Emacs (e.g., press­ing Alt with­out any oth­er keys some­times ac­ti­vates a menu that re­moves the key­board fo­cus, and al­so C-M short­cuts don't seem to work at al­l).</p> 
 <p>I've mem­o­rized very few key­board short­cut­s, even ones that might be use­ful to me (e.g., I don't re­mem­ber the short­cut to jump to a match­ing paren­the­sis). Usu­al­ly, if I am us­ing some mode or some­thing and I want to know how to do some­thing, I just Google it, and gen­er­al­ly find the an­swer with­in a few sec­ond­s.</p> 
 <p>There are sev­er­al ma­jor con­fig­u­ra­tion is­sues that I've yet to ad­dress, ei­ther due to lack of time or be­cause I could­n't find a suit­able so­lu­tion. A Su­perTab re­place­ment is one.  This is ac­tu­al­ly a big one, be­cause scrolling through a file just to see what's there is get­ting old­er and old­er, as is search­ing just to jump to a func­tion def­i­ni­tion.  If any­one knows of a good way to do this, please let me know.  I main­ly need it for Python files, but hav­ing it oth­er modes as well would be nice.  Ba­si­cal­ly, I just want some­thing that shows me all the class and func­tion def­i­ni­tions in the file, in or­der, that I can eas­i­ly se­lect one and jump to it.</p> 
 <p>Re­lat­ed to search­ing, search­ing in Emacs suck­s. I'm us­ing isearch+, which is an im­prove­men­t, but it still bugs me that search does not wrap around by de­fault. Al­so, for some rea­son, press­ing delete does­n't delete the last char­ac­ter you type­d, but the last char­ac­ter that it matched. That may sound mi­nor, but I use it a lot, so it's re­al­ly got­ten on my nerves.</p> 
 <p>Reg­u­lar ex­pres­sion search­ing in Emacs is use­less.  I can nev­er get it to work (usu­al­ly be­cause of dif­fer­ences be­tween () and ()).  What I re­al­ly want is an in­ter­ac­tive, us­er friend­ly, reg­u­lar ex­pres­sion search/search and re­place tool.  There's reg­ex­p-builder, but that's use­less be­cause once you build the reg­u­lar ex­pres­sion, you have to man­u­al­ly copy it and paste it in­to the re­al reg­u­lar ex­pres­sion search func­tion to ac­tu­al­ly use it.  And it does­n't work with search and re­place.</p> 
 <p>This last se­mes­ter I had a se­mes­ter long project in C.  For that, fly­make-­mode was a god­send.  It re­quires a bit of man­u­al con­fig­u­ra­tion (y­ou have to add some­thing to your Make­file, and you have to add some stuff to .emacs as al­ways to en­able it by de­fault­), but once you do that, it just work­s.  If you don't know what this is, ba­si­cal­ly, it high­lights the com­pil­er er­rors in your source in re­al time, as you type it.  So in­stead of do­ing some­thing stupid twen­ty times, and then com­pil­ing and find­ing them al­l, you do some­thing stupid on­ce, see the er­ror, and don't do make the mis­take any more.  It's al­so nice to close your ed­i­tor and know that your code will com­pile.</p> 
 <p>The Python mode I am mixed about.  On the one hand, it's re­al­ly awe­some how smart it is about in­den­ta­tion.  On the oth­er hand, the syn­tax high­light­ing is just shy of what I want (grant­ed, it's pret­ty good, but I want bet­ter than that).  For ex­am­ple, I want to be able to col­or doc­strings, sin­gle quot­ed strings, and dou­ble quot­ed strings dif­fer­ent­ly.  It would al­so be awe­some to get some col­or­ing in doc­strings it­self.  I'm think­ing mark­down mode for any text that's in a doc­string, ex­cept for doctest­s, which are col­ored in Python mode (or some vari­ant).</p> 
 <p>Some things I've not re­al­ly cared much about yet be­cause I haven't used that type of file yet.  For ex­am­ple, I'm cur­rent­ly writ­ing this post in Emac­s, and just now notic­ing the de­fi­cien­cies in htm­l-­mode (e.g., I want an easy way to se­lect text and turn it in­to a link, just like in the Word­Press ed­i­tor).</p> 
 <p>Fi­nal­ly, I've been try­ing to write my own theme.  That process has been slow and slight­ly painful.  Emacs is cur­rent­ly in the process of mov­ing to themes, though, so this is to be ex­pect­ed.  When Emacs 24 is ac­tu­al­ly re­leased I think it will be fair to judge how well this fea­ture work­s.</p> 
 <p>That's my wish­list (or most of it any­way).  But there are pos­i­tive things too. au­to-­com­plete-­mod­e, which I men­tioned at the top of my pre­vi­ous blog post, is ab­so­lute­ly awe­some.  I think this ex­ten­sion alone has made me more pro­duc­tive.</p> 
 <p>Some things I take for grant­ed, like au­to­mat­ic spell check­ing of strings and com­ments in Python (not en­abled by de­fault, but not hard to con­fig­ure ei­ther).  Thanks to some­one on an Emacs mail­ing list, I have the per­fect au­to­mat­ic clear­ing of trail­ing whites­pace, that au­to­mat­i­cal­ly leaves your white­space be­fore the cur­sor in the buffer, but still writes the clear to the file (see my .emacs file from my dot­files re­po linked to above for de­tail­s).</p> 
 <p>I've been hop­ing to learn Emacs lisp, so that I could rem­e­dy many of these prob­lems on my own, but so far I haven't re­al­ly had the free time.  Lisp is a very con­fus­ing lan­guage, so it's not easy to jump in­to (com­pared to the lan­guage vim us­es, which I found easy enough to hack on with­out know­ing at al­l).</p> 
 <p>Ul­ti­mate­ly, I'm quite pleased with how us­er friend­ly Emacs is, and with how easy it is to find out how to do al­most any­thing I want just by Googling it. Con­fig­u­ra­tion is an up­hill bat­tle.  Emacs has a ton of great pack­ages, many of which are in­clud­ed, but al­most none are en­abled by de­fault.  Just to­day I dis­cov­ered Ido mod­e, thanks to  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3/#comment-543">  David Li</a>.  I feel that in the long ter­m, as I learn Emacs Lisp, I can make it do what­ev­er I wan­t.  It pro­vides a good base­line edit­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, and a good frame­work for con­fig­ur­ing it to do what­ev­er you wan­t, and al­so enough peo­ple use it that 99% of the things you want are al­ready done by some­body.</p>
