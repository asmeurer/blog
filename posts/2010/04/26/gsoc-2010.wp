<html><body><p>So I applied for Google Summer of Code again this year, and I got accepted!  I will post more here later, but you can read the proposal abstract <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/python/t127230762920">here</a>.  The project is to improve the integrator in SymPy, making it faster, and able to solve more integrals.  </p></body></html>
