So the latest version of SymPy finally made it into <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">fink</a>.  Normally, this wouldn't be that exciting, but before this, the most recent version in fink was 0.6.4, which was before I ever joined the project, with the exception of two commits.  So this is the first version on fink to include all of my contributions, including my 2009 Google Summer of Code work.  </p></body></html>
