    <div><p></p><p>So about a month or so ago, I de­cid­ed that I need­ed to start learn­ing a com­mand line text ed­i­tor.  XCode, the ed­i­tor I had been us­ing for Python files, did­n't work very well with the new ver­sion (in par­tic­u­lar, the  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2009/12/29/automatically-remove-trailing-whitespace-in-xcode/">es­sen­tial plug­in</a>  that I'd been us­ing to clear trail­ing white­space on save does­n't yet work in XCode 4).  I'd been us­ing Tex­tWran­gler for oth­er things, and start­ed to switch to it for Python edit­ing too.  As far as free GUI text ed­i­tors on the Mac go, Tex­tWran­gler is the best.   </p> 
 <p>But I'd seen some of the nice fea­tures that vim has, like au­to­mat­i­cal­ly keep­ing all lines un­der 80 char­ac­ter­s, on a friend's com­put­er, and I de­cid­ed that I should try it.</p> 
 <p>Now, I had had a lit­tle pri­or ex­pe­ri­ence with both vim and emac­s, but all that I re­mem­bered was for vim that  <code>i</code>  in­serts and  <code>ZZ</code>  quits (for when I ac­ci­den­tal­ly open it) and for emac­s, that  <code>M-X doc­tor</code>  starts the psy­chi­a­trist.  </p> 
 <p>So I've de­cid­ed to try them out, do­ing it cold tur­key.  To make sure that I choose the bet­ter one, I've de­cid­ed to try both.  So, start­ing about a week ago, I've been us­ing noth­ing but vim for all my text edit­ing.  Start­ing in Jan­uary, I will try us­ing emac­s, and af­ter two week­s, I will see what I like bet­ter.</p> 
 <p>My opin­ions so far on vim:</p> 
 <div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;</span>The tutorials suck.  The best tutorial is <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>vimtutor<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> (type that in the command line), which I think comes with vim.  It's not bad, but it leaves out a few things that I would consider to be essential to a tutorial, for example, how to scroll (answer: use CTRL-D and CTRL-U).  I started the emacs tutorial a while back, and while I never finished it, from what I remember, it was much better (and I also remember that the first thing it talked about was how to scroll by more than one line at a time). It also left out the <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>.<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> command, which I think is rather useful.  I did print out <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>this cheatsheet<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> and have it sitting next to me on my desk.  That has helped a lot.  I hope I can find something similar for emacs when I get to it.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>vim is too line oriented.  vi started out as an extension to ed, the line editor, so this is not surprising.  But I still can't understand why pressing <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>l<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> at the end of a line can't bring me to the beginning of the next line.  Maybe I'm just still doing it wrong (supposedly, you should rarely use <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>h<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> and <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>l<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> over more efficient moving commands).  <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Somewhat related to the last point, vim really likes to ring the terminal bell a lot. To quote <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Wikipedia<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>, "vi has two modes – 'beep repeatedly' and 'break everything'"<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I managed to customize it to the point of usability (there are still several things I need to go in and figure out how to fix).  See https://github.com/asmeurer/dotfiles for my .vimrc and .vim/ files.  I found a decent Python syntax file, but it's actually not that great.  I modified it to color single quoted strings different from double quoted strings (a feature I missed from Xcode). I still need to make a better color scheme (preferably the same as Xcode's midnight), but this is enough work that I've put it off.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Pressing ESC all the time is really annoying.  Sometimes, I just arrow over, even though I know you're not "supposed to", just because my fingers don't want to reach over and press ESC.  I'm also really used to using control sequences to move around while typing, which of course doesn't work in vim.  In fact, so far, I'm suspecting that I'll like emacs better.  But I've vowed to give both a fair chance.  But so far, my impression is that vim is a great for text <span class="nt">&lt;em&gt;</span>editing<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;</span>, but not so hot for text <span class="nt">&lt;em&gt;</span>writing<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;</span> (unless you always write text perfectly, so that you never need to leave insert mode until you are done typing).  Just the simple act of deleting a mistyped word (yes, word, that happens a lot when you are decently fast touch typist) takes several keystrokes, when it should in my opinion only take one (two if you count the meta-key).<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>The customizability is really nice.  So far, everything that I've thought of to change has been changeable.  Also, language is easy enough to understand that I was able to modify the Python syntax file without any difficulty.  <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I like how it syntax highlights virtually everything I throw at it. <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If there are any vim ex­perts out there read­ing this, I have some ques­tion­s:</p> 
 <div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Is there an easy way to get a list of and jump to a function/class definition in a Python file?  In Xcode and TextWrangler, there was a nice popup at the top of the window that I could access these from.  In vim, so far the best I've found is searching for it, which isn't very efficient.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I got TAB to indent 4 spaces in Python, but for some reason, when I create a new line after a <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>:<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, it puts 8 extra spaces. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the result of some mismatch/error in <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://github.com/asmeurer/dotfiles"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>my .vimrc or .vim/ files<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>, but I don't know how to fix it<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Any useful tricks to share?  Especially for editing Python files.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>How long did it take you to become reasonably efficient with vim?<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>ED­IT: I thought of some more ques­tion­s:</strong> 
     </p><li>Is there a way to make vim con­sid­er camel­Case to be word bound­aries?</li> 
 <p>Fi­nal­ly, if any­one else is think­ing of start­ing vim, I have some use­ful things I've al­ready found in my .vim­r­c. So you might take a look at that, and add the ones that you like to your .vim­r­c.  Fi­nal­ly, if you are on Mac OS X, you should use  <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTer­m2</a>.  Ac­tu­al­ly, you should use this re­gard­less of what text ed­i­tor you use.  It's a very good Ter­mi­nal.app re­place­ment that has vir­tu­al­ly all the fea­tures (with a cou­ple of ex­cep­tion­s) as Ter­mi­nal.ap­p, and a ton of ex­tra ones.  The one I want to men­tion here is mouse re­port­ing sup­port, so you can use your mouse to do things in vim.  This is very use­ful, as some­times, e.g., when se­lect­ing tex­t, us­ing the mouse is just more ef­fi­cien­t.  Al­so, if you get frus­trat­ed try­ing to re­mem­ber the com­mands that will move around you faster than  <code>h</code>,  <code>j</code>,  <code>k</code>, and  <code>l</code>, you can just click on where you want to go.</p>
