    <div><p></p><p>So now that Google has  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/accepted-gsoc-students-announced/">an­nounced the re­sults</a>  of Google Sum­mer of Code, I want to write down some gen­er­al things that I no­ticed when re­view­ing ap­pli­ca­tions while they are still fresh in my mind.   </p> 
 <p>Note that none of these things ap­ply to any spe­cif­ic stu­dent who ap­plied to SymPy.  Many of these things are things that I no­ticed that peo­ple did right.   </p> 
 <p>Most of this should ap­ply to any or­ga­ni­za­tion, though some of them might be SymPy speci­fic, since that is the lens that I am view­ing this through.  These aren't re­al­ly in any par­tic­u­lar or­der.   </p> 
 <p></p><ol>
    <li><strong>Ful­fill all the re­quire­ments.</strong>  This is kind of a no brain­er, and as it turns out, al­most all stu­dents who ap­plied to SymPy did in­deed do this.  For SymPy, this means that you should sub­mit a patch by the dead­line. Oth­er or­ga­ni­za­tions might have oth­er re­quire­ments.  If you don't ful­fill the re­quire­ments, it does­n't mat­ter how good your ap­pli­ca­tion is; you won't be el­i­gi­ble and hence won't be ac­cept­ed.</li> 
     <li><strong>Dis­cuss your pro­pos­al on the mail­ing list.</strong>  A pro­pos­al sub­mit­ted out of the blue has a poor chance of be­ing ac­cept­ed.  First, we like to see that you will be in­volved in the com­mu­ni­ty, and if you don't dis­cuss the pro­pos­al at al­l, it shows bad­ly.  Sec­ond, it is very like­ly that we will not like some­thing about your pro­pos­al, or will have ques­tions (see the next point).  If you don't dis­cuss it at al­l, you are mak­ing a shot in the dark.  Even if the pro­pos­al is good, it could be re­ject­ed sim­ply be­cause it's not some­thing that we feel that we wan­t. And you don't want to ac­ci­den­tal­ly sub­mit a pro­pos­al to do some­thing that has al­ready been im­ple­ment­ed.  
 <p>It's im­­por­­tant to dis­­­cuss it on the pub­­lic mail­ing list, not just with a spe­­cif­ic men­­tor.  Even if that men­­tor is the ex­pert on your project sub­­­ject and would like­­ly be the per­­son to men­­tor you if you are ac­­cep­t­ed, you need to re­mem­ber that all the men­­tors re­view the pro­­pos­als and de­­cide who to ac­­cep­t.   Al­­so, this year for SymPy, we are try­ing to put an em­pha­­sis on stu­­dents do­ing things pub­­licly with the whole com­­mu­ni­­ty, in­­stead of just with their men­­tors.</p></li> 
     <li><strong>Ask the men­tors for ad­vice on your pro­pos­al, and then fol­low it.</strong>  Again, most stu­dents who ap­plied to SymPy were good on this one too.  We re­quest that all stu­dents put their pro­pos­als on the GitHub wik­i, so that the men­tors can take a look at them and give ad­vice.  If you feel un­com­fort­able putting your ap­pli­ca­tion in a pub­lic place, send it to some men­tors pri­vate­ly.  
 <p>But the most im­­por­­tant thing here is to ac­­tu­al­­ly fol­low any ad­vice that the men­­tors give you.  If they tell you that you should ex­­pand your time­­line sec­­tion, you should ex­­pand your time­­line sec­­tion.  If they tell you you should dis­­­cuss the im­­ple­­men­­ta­­tion more, you should do that (see the next point).  If you don't fol­low the ad­vice, it looks to the men­­tor like you did­n't lis­ten to him, which does­n't make you ap­­pear like a good can­di­­date for ac­­cep­­tance.  Al­­so, the things that they tell you to im­prove will tend to be the things that they will look at when re­view­ing your pro­­pos­al.    </p></li> 
     <li><strong>Don't just dis­cuss the the­o­ry.</strong>  I sus­pect that this may be more of a prob­lem with SymPy than for oth­er or­ga­ni­za­tion­s, be­cause SymPy is very math based, so many of the pro­pos­als to SymPy in­volve com­plex math­e­mat­ic­s. One of the big­gest is­sues I saw in pro­pos­als was that stu­dents dis­cussed the the­o­ry of what they want­ed to im­ple­ment too much and not enough of the ac­tu­al im­ple­men­ta­tion. It's easy to do this, but dis­cussing the im­ple­men­ta­tion is ac­tu­al­ly more im­por­tant than the the­o­ry of what you want to do.  
 <p>An easy way to do this is to give a "fake" ex­am­­ple ses­­sion show­ing how your code might work af­ter it is com­­plet­ed.  For ex­am­­ple, if you were writ­ing a pro­­pos­al for a PDE solver, you might in­­­clude some­thing like</p>  
  <p>[code lan­guage="py"]</p>  
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; u = Func­­tion('u')</p>  
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Solve the Heat Equa­­tion in one di­­men­­sion</p>  
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; pde­s­olve(u(x, t).d­if­f(t) - c*<em>2</em>u(x, t).d­if­f(x, x), u(x), {u(x, 0):f(x), u(0, t):0, u(0, pi):0}, method­­='sep­a­ra­­tion of var­i­ables')   </p>  
  <p>2/pi<em>Sum(In­te­­gral(f(x)</em>sin(n<em>x), x)</em>sin(n<em>x)</em>ex­p(-n<strong>2*c</strong>2*t), (n, 1, oo))</p>  
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Use Fouri­er Tran­s­­forms to get d'Alem­bert's So­lu­­tion to the Wave Equa­­tion</p>  
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; …</p>  
  <p>[/­­code]</p>  
  <p>in your pro­­pos­al.  Just say­ing "I plan to im­­ple­­ment solvers for PDEs us­ing sep­a­ra­­tion of var­i­ables and Fouri­er Tran­s­­for­m­s" tells us on­­ly what we al­ready know, which is that you can solve PDEs us­ing sep­a­ra­­tion of var­i­ables and Fouri­er Tran­s­­for­m­s.  What we don't know is how it will look.  The above ex­am­­ple shows how the PDE, in­i­­tial/bound­­ary con­di­­tion­s, and method are en­tered by the user, and how the out­­put look­s.    </p>  
  <p>A more ad­­vanced thing that you can do is to give ac­­tu­al pro­­to­­type code. This is not re­quired, but it can show that you are ded­i­­cat­ed enough to get a start, and can de­mon­s­trate how things will work for more com­­pli­­cat­ed pro­jec­t­s.</p></li> 
     <li><strong>But the­o­ry is im­por­tant too.</strong>  This might al­so be a prob­lem more in SymPy, but maybe not.  The math­e­mat­i­cal back­grounds of SymPy de­vel­op­ers ranges quite a bit.  For ex­am­ple, I know a lot about the com­pli­cat­ed Risch Al­go­rithm for sym­bol­ic in­te­gra­tion that the ma­jor­i­ty of peo­ple (even among SymPy de­vel­op­er­s) know hard­ly any­thing about, but I know ba­si­cal­ly noth­ing about quan­tum me­chan­ic­s.  So that more men­tors can have a chance to even have a clue about what you are talk­ing about when they are re­view­ing your pro­pos­al, you should try to ex­plain things to a gen­er­al au­di­ence, at least in the in­tro­duc­tion of your pro­pos­al.  It can al­so help to ex­plain why your project would be use­ful, so that even if some­one does­n't know what it is, they can see why it would be nice to have.  This does­n't mean that you should sac­ri­fice de­tails by dumb­ing ev­ery­thing down.  There's a pret­ty good chance that some­one will un­der­stand what you are talk­ing about in your specific­s, but you should al­so ex­plain things from the oth­er end.
 <p>If you are im­­ple­­men­t­ing a spe­­cif­ic al­­go­rith­m, maybe you could give a brief over­view of the al­­go­rith­m.  This will not on­­ly ex­­plain things to the men­­tors who might not know how it work­s, but al­­so it shows that you know how it works too.</p></li> 
     <li><strong>Be in­volved in the com­mu­ni­ty.</strong>  We un­der­stand that stu­dents have class­es dur­ing the ap­pli­ca­tion pe­ri­od, but the more you in­volve your­self in the com­mu­ni­ty be­yond the patch re­quire­ment (or what­ev­er re­quire­ment some oth­er org might have), the bet­ter your chances of be­ing ac­cept­ed. Ev­ery org has to take risks ac­cept­ing stu­dents, be­cause there is al­ways the chance that they will fail.  This is not good for any­one: the stu­dent does­n't get paid the full stipend and the or­ga­ni­za­tion loos­es not on­ly the project that would have been im­ple­ment­ed, but al­so the slot that they could have giv­en to some­one who would­n't have failed.  In­volv­ing your­self in the com­mu­ni­ty ear­ly is the best way to show the com­mu­ni­ty that you are a low risk for fail­ure.</li> 
     <li><strong>The pro­pos­al is the most im­por­tant thing.</strong>  But don't as­sume that just be­cause you are in­volved in the com­mu­ni­ty that you will be ac­cept­ed.  The most im­por­tant thing is the pro­pos­al.  If you don't have a good pro­pos­al, we will not even con­sid­er the rest of your ac­tiv­i­ty.  So you should fo­cus most of your en­er­gy on writ­ing a high qual­i­ty pro­pos­al.  The qual­i­ty of the patch and your in­volve­ment in the com­mu­ni­ty are sec­ondary con­sid­er­a­tions af­ter the qual­i­ty of the pro­pos­al.  These might be used to nar­row down the list of good pro­pos­als to fit the num­ber of slots Google gives us and the num­ber of men­tors we have avail­able, but the first phase is al­ways to nar­row down the list based on the qual­i­ty of the pro­pos­al­s.</li> 
     <li><strong>Use a con­sis­tant nick­name, prefer­ably one based on your re­al name.</strong>   This is some­thing that I think most peo­ple do not re­al­ize.  If your re­al name is John Smith, and your IRC nick, GitHub han­dle, Google Code han­dle, and GSoC link_id are all jsmith, it makes it very easy for me to as­so­ciate in my mind: "OK, that per­son who just sub­mit­ted that patch is the same per­son I talked to on IRC last week, and I re­mem­ber read­ing his pro­pos­al on google-me­lange.­com."  But if your re­al name is John Smith, your IRC nick is free­bird, your GitHub han­dle is mr.nice, your Google Code han­dle is smithy, and your link_id on google-me­lange.­com is johnh­smith, I can have a very hard time as­so­ci­at­ing your work in one place with your work in an­oth­er (my apolo­gies if those are any­bodys' re­al nick­names; I just made them up to make the point here).  Maybe you ac­tu­al­ly have been very ac­tive in the IRC chan­nel, but it is hard for me to re­al­ize that based on your nick vs. your re­al name.  This year for SymPy, we had 25 ap­pli­ca­tions by 25 stu­dents.  None of these stu­dents were mem­bers of the SymPy com­mu­ni­ty a few months ago.  It's very hard for the oth­er men­tors and I to keep track of which nick­names as­so­ciate with which peo­ple, and in the end, we may mis­tak­en­ly be­lieve that you haven't done as much as you re­al­ly have.  Your best bet is to use one nick­name ev­ery­where, and to make it based on your re­al name, so that we can eas­i­ly tell who it is even based on the nick­name.  If your name is com­mon enough that no one per­mu­ta­tion is guar­an­teed to be avail­able ev­ery­where, at least try to be con­sis­tent with your nick­name, or just use dif­fer­ent per­mu­ta­tions of your re­al name based on what site you are on.</li> 
 </ol>
<p>That's all I can think of for now.  I kind of wish I had thought of two more, so I could make it "Ten pieces of ad­vice," but what­ev­er.  If any SymPy men­tors or men­tors from oth­er projects feel that some­thing is miss­ing, I would love to hear about it in the com­ments.</p></div>
