<p>For a long time, there have been sev­er­al prob­lems in my  <code>in­te­gra­tion3</code>  branch that were fixed in  <code>mas­ter</code>.  I de­cid­ed that as an in­cen­tive to fin­ish the re­lease, I would hold off on merg­ing  <code>mas­ter</code>  in­to my branch un­til the 0.7.0 re­lease was fin­ished.  Well, here's a lit­tle time­line:</p> 
 <p></p>
<ul>
    <li>
<strong>June 28, 2011:</strong>  SymPy 0.7.0 fi­nal is re­leased.</li> 
     <li>
<strong>June 29, 2011:</strong>  I type  <code>git merge sympy-0.7.0</code>  in my  <code>in­te­gra­tion3</code>  branch.</li> 
     <li>
<strong>Ju­ly 24, 2011 (to­day; tech­ni­cal­ly Ju­ly 25 be­cause it's 2 AM):</strong>  I fin­ish merg­ing  <code>sympy-0.7.0</code>  in­to  <code>in­te­gra­tion3</code>.</li> 
 </ul>
<p>That's right, it took me over three week­s---al­most a mon­th---­to merge  <code>sympy-0.7.0</code>  in­to  <code>in­te­gra­tion3</code>  (grant­ed, I worked on oth­er things at the same time, such as the  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/commit/52657848516ce7f4f7119b921d6b8d64131b58d3" target="_blank">SciPy 2011 con­fer­ence</a>, but to me, any merge that takes longer than a day to com­plete is a prob­lem).  This is be­cause git de­cid­ed that I need­ed to fix as a merge con­flict just about ev­ery sin­gle change in the re­lease branch since the base of  <code>in­te­gra­tion3</code>.  The to­tal was over 100 files.  You can see the fi­nal merge com­mit  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/commit/52657848516ce7f4f7119b921d6b8d64131b58d3" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 
 <p>So I start­ed  <code>git merge­tool</code>, with­out which this whole or­deal would have been 10 times worse.  The merge­tool, which on my com­put­er is open­dif­f, i.e., File Merge, gave the cor­rect change by de­fault in most cas­es, so I ac­tu­al­ly did not have to man­u­al­ly fix the ma­jor­i­ty of the con­flict­s.  But I did have to go through and do a lot of them.  I had to man­u­al­ly check each dif­fer­ence in the polys, as I had made sev­er­al changes there in the course of work­ing on  <code>in­te­gra­tion3</code>.  In sev­er­al oc­ci­saion­s, I had to re­search a change us­ing  <code>git log -S</code>  and fan­cy meth­od­s.  And I no­ticed at least two re­gres­sions in the polys, which I fixed.</p> 
 <p>merge­tool was use­less against  <code>risch.py</code>  and  <code>test_risch.py</code>, be­cause in my branch I had re­named these to  <code>heurisch.py</code>  and  <code>test_heurisch.py</code>.  For­tu­nate­ly, these were not re­al­ly mod­i­fied much by me, so I could ba­si­cal­ly just re­place them with the  <code>sympy-0.7.0</code>  ver­sion­s.</p> 
 <p>Once I fin­ished merg­ing I had to deal with test fail­ures.  This was part­ly ex­pect­ed, as my branch has al­ways had test fail­ures due to my hack dis­abling al­ge­bra­ic sub­sti­tu­tion in  <code>exp</code>, which is re­quired for  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>  to work, but there were al­so sev­er­al un­re­lat­ed ones.   </p> 
 <p>Some of these were caused by wrong merge con­flict res­o­lu­tions by me.  So I went through  <code>git diff sympy-0.7.0</code>  change by change and made sure that noth­ing was dif­fer­ent that I did­n't want to be.  I would rec­om­mend do­ing this for any big merge.</p> 
 <p>Then, I had to fix a few bugs that caused test fail­ures.  Sev­er­al se­man­tics were changed in the re­lease.  I think the ones that I had to change were the re­nam­ing of  <code>has_any_sym­bols</code>  to just  <code>has</code>, the re­nam­ing of  <code>Poly.as_ba­sic()</code>  to  <code>Poly.as_­ex­pr()</code>, and the swap­ping of the mean­ings of  <code>quo</code>  and  <code>exquo</code>  in the polys.  There were al­so some doctest fail­ures due to the change to lex­i­co­graph­ic or­der­ing in the print­er.</p> 
 <p>Af­ter all that, there were two re­gres­sions that caused test fail­ures.  The first was the fol­low­ing:</p>

<p>This sub­sti­tu­tion is nec­es­sary be­cause the Risch al­go­rithm re­quires ex­pres­sions like $la­tex x^x$ to be rewrit­ten as $la­tex e^{x\log(x)}$ be­fore it can in­te­grate them, but I try to con­vert them back af­ter in­te­grat­ing so that the us­er gets the same thing in the re­sult that he en­tered.  I cre­at­ed  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=2571" target="_blank">is­sue 2571</a>  for this.</p> 
 <p>The sec­ond was that I had sev­er­al places in my doc­strings with things like</p> 
 <blockquote>

Given a derivation D on k[t] and f, g in k(t) with f weakly normalized with respect to t, either raise NonElementaryIntegralException, in which case the equation Dy + f*y == g has no solution in k(t), or the quadruplet (a, b, c, h) such that a, h in k[t], b, c in k, and for any solution y in k(t) of Dy + f*y == g, q = y*h in k satisfies a*Dq + b*q == c.

</blockquote>

<p>The prob­lem here is the "raise NonEle­men­tary­In­te­gralEx­cep­tion," part.  The code qual­i­ty check­er things that this is an old style ex­cep­tion (like  <code>raise Ex­cep­tion, mes­sage</code>), due to a poor­ly formed reg­u­lar ex­pres­sion.  I fixed this in a  <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/511" target="_blank">pull re­quest</a>.</p> 
 <p>The good news is that now a lot of stuff works that did­n't be­fore be­cause of fix­es that were re­quired that on­ly ex­ist­ed in  <code>mas­ter</code>.  For ex­am­ple, the fol­low­ing did not work be­fore, but now does due to im­prove­ments to  <code>Root­Sum</code>:</p>

<p>The gen­er­al def­i­ni­tion of the log­a­rith­mic part of an in­te­gral is a sum over the roots of a poly­no­mi­al, which must be ex­pressed as a  <code>Root­Sum</code>  in the gen­er­al case.  Pre­vi­ous­ly,  <code>Root­Sum.d­iff</code>  did not work, but thanks to Ma­teusz, an al­go­rithm for com­put­ing ex­act­ly the Root­Sum where the Lamb­da ex­pres­sion is a ra­tio­nal func­tion was im­ple­ment­ed (see  <a href="http://mattpap.github.com/scipy-2011-tutorial/html/mathematics.html#summing-roots-of-polynomials" target="_blank">this bit</a>  from our SciPy tu­to­ri­al for an idea on how this work­s), so now the Risch Al­go­rithm can work with Root­Sum ob­jects just as well with as an or­di­nary sum of log­a­rithm­s.</p> 
 <p>Al­so, there was a bug in the square free al­go­rithm in my branch that was fixed in  <code>mas­ter</code>  that was caus­ing wrong re­sults (I don't re­mem­ber the ex­pres­sion that pro­duced them right now), and al­so there was a fix by me in  <code>mas­ter</code>  to make  <code>is_ra­tional_­func­tion()</code>  faster, as it was sig­nif­i­cant­ly slow­ing down the cal­cu­la­tion of some in­te­grals (for ex­am­ple,  <code>risch_in­te­grate(Ad­d(<em>(ex­p(i</em>x) for i in range(1000))))</code>, which is still slow to cal­cu­late, but now it's be­cause of oth­er things).</p> 
 <p><strong>About big branch­es</strong></p> 
 <p>So this merge, along with the poly12 fi­as­co (which by the way, I think part of the rea­son git made me do all these merge con­flict res­o­lu­tions was be­cause  <code>polys12</code>  was re­based from the  <code>polys11</code>  I had merged in­to in­te­gra­tion3), has shown me very clear­ly that it is very bad to go off with your own branch and do a lot of work and wait a long time be­fore merg­ing it back in­to the main re­po.</p> 
 <p>This is what was done with  <code>polys12</code>.  Ma­teusz had a lot of new poly­no­mi­als code that he de­vel­oped in one big branch, and when it fi­nal­ly came to merg­ing it back in, it was a mess.  This was for sev­er­al rea­son­s, which I do not want to dis­cuss too much here, but it be­came clear to ev­ery­one I think that do­ing this was bad, and that it would have been bet­ter to have sub­mit­ted many changes as pull re­quests as they were made than keep­ing them all to­geth­er in one big branch for a long time.</p> 
 <p>This mod­el al­so af­fect­ed my work, as I had to work off of lat­est the polys branch, not  <code>mas­ter</code>, as my work re­lied heav­i­ly on the lat­est and great­est in the polys.   </p> 
 <p>Well, with this merge of the main re­po in­to my branch, I see that my branch is start­ing to be­come the same way.  I orig­i­nal­ly thought that I should fin­ish the Risch al­go­rithm be­fore sub­mit­ting it to be merged in­to  <code>mas­ter</code>.  I know know that this is the wrong ap­proach.  De­vel­op­ment in  <code>mas­ter</code>  is too fast to keep code away from it for too long.  The di­ver­gence makes it more and more dif­fi­cult to merge back with ev­ery time.  Fur­ther­more, there are re­gres­sions that were nev­er no­ticed to be re­gres­sions be­cause the code that would have shown them ex­ist­ed on­ly in my branch.  Now I have to fix the­se, where­as if the code were in  <code>mas­ter</code>, the re­gres­sion would have nev­er hap­pened in the first place, be­cause the au­thor would have seen it im­me­di­ate­ly from the test fail­ures.</p> 
 <p>I al­so thought that I should wait to merge be­cause there were so many bugs in my code.  But I see now that this is al­so wrong.  Merg­ing with  <code>mas­ter</code>  will help me find these bugs, as peo­ple will ac­tu­al­ly use my code.  Sure, I've asked peo­ple to try out  <code>risch_in­te­grate()</code>, and some peo­ple have (and I thank you), but hav­ing it in the de­fault  <code>in­te­grate()</code>  in  <code>mas­ter</code>  will re­sult in find­ing more bugs in the code than I ev­er would alone, which is ba­si­cal­ly the way it is right now with the code liv­ing on­ly in my own branch.</p> 
 <p>I would pre­pare my code for merg­ing with  <code>mas­ter</code>  to­day, if it weren't for this  <code>ex­p.­subs</code>  hack, which caus­es test fail­ures and is tech­ni­cal­ly a re­gres­sion, but is re­quired for the prepars­ing code to the Risch al­go­rithm to work.  This is why I  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sympy/browse_thread/thread/4a19d0f39f51fda6#" target="_blank">wrote to the list</a>  two weeks ago ask­ing for ad­vice on how to struc­ture the sub­sti­tu­tion code so that we can nice­ly have var­i­ous kinds of sub­sti­tu­tions (e.g., ex­act like I need and al­ge­bra­ic like cur­rent­ly ex­ists in  <code>exp</code>) liv­ing to­geth­er with­out clut­ter­ing up the code.</p> 
 <p>There­fore, I am go­ing to fo­cus my en­er­gies on fix­ing this subs prob­lem so I can get my code merged with  <code>mas­ter</code>.  Then, when this is done, I will con­tin­ue my work on im­ple­ment­ing the re­main­ing cas­es of the Risch al­go­rith­m.   </p> 
 <p>So let this tale be a warn­ing to peo­ple work­ing on a lot of code in a big branch.  This es­pe­cial­ly ap­plies to our GSoC stu­dents, as it's ex­treme­ly easy to let your code ac­cu­mu­late when you're a GSoC stu­dent (tech­ni­cal­ly this branch of mine is a GSoC branch).  I see that some of our stu­dents are do­ing a bet­ter job of this than oth­er­s.  To those who have your code all in one big branch that has­n't been merged, I rec­om­mend you ready your branch for merge now.  And in the fu­ture, try to break your code up in­to small but still mean­ing­ful chunks and sub­mit those as pull re­quest­s.  With git, it's easy to base the code you are cur­rent­ly work­ing on on code that has­n't been merged yet, while still keep­ing things in small chunks for the pull re­quest­s.   </p> 
 <p>On the oth­er hand, git will on­ly take you so far if you keep ev­ery­thing in a big branch, be­cause there are go­ing to be changes in  <code>mas­ter</code>  that will af­fect your work, no mat­ter how iso­lat­ed you think it is, and these are the sorts of things that it is im­pos­si­ble for git to fix for you.  But if your code is in  <code>mas­ter</code>, it will be sup­port­ed by ev­ery­one, and any ma­jor change that af­fects it will have to fix it. For ex­am­ple, if some­one changes a print­er and the doctests change, then he will have to change your doctest too if it's in  <code>mas­ter</code>, but if it's in your branch, then you will have to fix it when you next merge/re­base with­/a­gainst  <code>mas­ter</code>.</p>
