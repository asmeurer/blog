<p>So this past week, I at­tend­ed the SciPy 2011 con­fer­ence in Austin, TX, which was my first con­fer­ence ev­er.  Here are some high­lights of the con­fer­ence for me:</p> 
 <p></p>
<ul>
    <li>I met a  <em>ton</em>  of cool peo­ple.  This in­clud­ed meet­ing sev­er­al peo­ple who I had pre­vi­ous­ly known from mail­ing lists in per­son for the first time.  I met the SymPy de­vel­op­ers Ma­teusz Pa­proc­ki and Andy Ter­rel, and I al­so had al­ready known or heard about peo­ple like Fer­nan­do Perez, Gael Varo­quaux, and Robert Kern.  There are a lot of peo­ple out there who are ex­cit­ed to be us­ing Python for their re­search, which is a re­al re­fresh­er from my uni­ver­si­ty, where ev­ery­one is us­ing Mat­lab and Maple.</li> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Mateusz and I gave a tutorial on SymPy.  This was one of the four introductory track tutorials.  This was a great experience to teach SymPy to people.  You can see the <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://mattpap.github.com/scipy-2011-tutorial/html/index.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Sphinx document<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> that we used, and there should eventually be a video posted at the <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2011/tutorials.php#mateusz"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>SciPy 2011 website<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>In addition to our tutorial, I attended some of the other tutorials.  I particularly enjoyed the NumPy tutorial. Having never used NumPy before, I now feel comfortable with the basics.  I also attended Gael Varoquaux's tutorial on scikits.learn and Corran Webster's tutorial on Matplotlib, Traits, and Chaco. My only regret is that the advanced track and introductory track tutorials were held at the same time, so I could not attend half of them.  I plan to watch the ones I missed online.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>The general conference was excellent.  Some of the talks that I particularly enjoyed were:
</pre></div>


<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The key­notes.  I found Er­ic Jone's key­note par­tic­u­lar­ly rel­e­vant as the lead­er of SymPy, as he talked about some of the good things to do and bad things to not do when lead­ing a sci­en­tif­ic projec­t.  I al­so en­joyed Per­ry Green­field­'s talk about how the as­tron­o­my com­mu­ni­ty moved from some old pro­pri­etary sys­tem to Python.</li> 
     <li>Ma­teusz gave a talk on his  <a href="http://lab.femhub.org/">FEMhub on­line lab</a>, which a was very im­pres­sive sys­tem for us­ing Python en­tire­ly in the web brows­er.</li> 
     <li>By far the best talk of the en­tire con­fer­ence was Fer­nan­do Perez's talk on the new IPython 0.11, which will be com­ing out in about a week or so.  His de­mo of the new fea­tures such as the QT con­sole and html note­book were very im­pres­sive.  If you want to watch just one video from the con­fer­ence, I would rec­om­mend that one.</li> 
     <li>Mark Dew­ing gave a talk about a sys­tem he wrote us­ing SymPy to do au­to­mat­ed deriva­tion of equa­tion­s.  The sys­tem is im­pres­sive, and con­tains some fea­tures that would be nice to back­port to SymPy.  He told me that he wants to do this, so fol­low the mail­ing list.  You can see what he has so far on his  <a href="https://github.com/markdewing/sympy/tree/derivation_modeling">deriva­tion_­mod­el­ing</a>  branch at GitHub.</li> 
     <li>The light­ning talk­s.  These are very short talks at the end of the con­fer­ence that are on­ly five min­utes long.  In ad­di­tion to many in­ter­est­ing talk­s, both Ma­teusz and I gave a light­ning talk. Ma­teusz gave a talk on  <a href="http://live.sympy.org/">SymPy Live</a>, which he re­cent­ly im­proved to do things like give La­TeX out­put, and I gave a talk on my work with the Risch al­go­rith­m.  I would al­so high­ly rec­om­mend watch this talk once they post the videos.</li> 
     <li>Again, re­gret­tably, I could not at­tend half of the talks be­cause they were held at the same time.  For­tu­nate­ly, they filmed all of them, so I hope to watch them all on­line when they are post­ed (and I rec­om­mend that you do too).</li>
</ul>
    
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>The sprints were a great time for getting together and hacking together.  I worked with Min Ragan-Kelley to make isympy work with the new IPython.  Having fixed this, I now want to release 0.7.1 very soon, so I used some of the time during the sprints getting ready for that.  We already have <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes-for-0.7.1"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>preliminary release notes<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>, and my hope is to create a release candidate on Monday (tomorrow).  I also finished up my <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/491"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>MathJax branch<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> and finished reviewing and pushed in Tom's first GSoC pull request, which has a lot of really cool stuff relating to converting hypergeometric functions and Meijer G-functions into standard elementary functions.  This will all be in the release.
</pre></div>


<p>Al­so at the sprints, Ma­teusz worked on an ex­ten­sion for our Sphinx docs that puts a SymPy Live con­sole right in the doc­s.  You can then click on "e­val­u­ate" next to any of the code ex­am­ples, and it will run it in SymPy live.  And of course, you can then ed­it it and play around with it.  He al­ready had a work­ing ver­sion of this by the end of the sprints (with a few bugs stil­l), but I don't think he has pushed it to GitHub yet.  I think this is go­ing to be a land­mark change for our doc­u­men­ta­tion.  SymPy Live runs on the App En­gine, so this ap­proach can be ap­plied to any li­brary that can run in pure Python 2.5, and I think a lot of such projects are go­ing to be jeal­ous this and want to start us­ing it, be­cause it's very im­pres­sive and use­ful.</p> 
 <p>We al­so had a cou­ple of peo­ple from the con­fer­ence come to our ta­ble and work on SymPy.  These were peo­ple who were new to SymPy, and I think at­tend­ed our tu­to­ri­al.  One of them, Em­ma Hogan, worked a lit­tle bit on im­prov­ing our doc­u­men­ta­tion, and has sub­mit­ted a  <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/490">pull re­quest</a>.</p> 


 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Austin, TX is a nice city with lots of fun places to go, but it is also very humid, which is something I could barely stand (I am used to the same heat, but in Albuquerque it is dry heat).  One interesting thing that some of us went and saw was the bats.  The bridge over this lake in Austin has over a million bats living under it, and at night they all fly out to feed.  <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


</ul>

<p>There's all kinds of fun and in­ter­est­ing stuff that hap­pened that I did not men­tion here.  If you are in­ter­est­ed in sci­ence and Python, I would high­ly rec­om­mend at­tend­ing a fu­ture SciPy con­fer­ence.   </p>
