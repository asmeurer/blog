<p>I've always wanted to learn how to write native apps for iOS and the Mac as
long as either has existed.  However, the barrier of entry has always been too
high, given that I only ever had time to play with them as a hobby.  The
Objective-C programming language is a bit complicated to learn, especially
alongside all the memory management that you have to do (and it doesn't help
that Apple has gone through several memory management schemes through Mac OS X
versions).  To add on to that, the Cocoa framework is huge, and it's quite
daunting to even know where to get started with it.</p>
<p>With Apple's announcement of the
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift programming language</a> in June, it
was clear to me that the language would significantly lower the barrier of
entry.  The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">XCode 6 beta</a> is
now public (i.e., you do not need to have a paid Apple Developer account to
access it), so anyone can play with Swift.</p>
<p>Note that I am still <em>very</em> new to both Swift and iOS development in general,
so it's quite likely that some of the things I mention here are actually bad
ideas.  If you know more than I do and spot a bad thing that I am doing,
please mention it in the comments.</p>
<p>It's also possible that some of the assumptions I've made about the Swift
language or the SpriteKit framework are actually wrong. Please remember that I
am still a beginner and take what I say with a grain of salt.</p>
<h2>The Swift Language</h2>
<p>If you don't know how to program at all, I don't know how well this will work
for you. I already know several language, especially Python, so my experience
derives from that.</p>
<p>First, read through the
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/">Swift language guide</a>. If you
have XCode 6, you can read it interactively as a Playground. I only have read
through the first part so far, which gives a high-level overview of the
language.</p>
<p>The Swift language is actually quite easy to learn, especially if you already
know a high-level language like Python.  A few important things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>var</code> and <code>let</code> seem a bit confusing.  The difference is actually quite
simple: <code>var</code> denotes a variable that can change and <code>let</code> denotes a
variable that cannot.  You could in theory just use <code>var</code> for everything,
but <code>let</code> lets the compiler spot mistakes for you, and it also probably lets
it make your code faster.  If you intend to never change the value of a
variable, use <code>let</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Swift uses type inference, meaning that you usually don't need to specify
types. But when you do, you do so by putting a <code>:</code> after the variable name,
like <code>var a: Int = 2</code> or <code>func f(a: Int)</code>.  The exception is the return type
of a function, which uses the arrow <code>-&gt;</code> (if you are familiar with Python 3
type annotations, the syntax is exactly the same), <code>func f(a: Int) -&gt; Int</code>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Swift uses <code>?</code> after a type name to indicate that a variable could be its
given type, or <code>nil</code>. If you are familiar with Haskell, this is like the
Maybe monad.  I know very little Haskell, so I don't know if Swift's
implementation of <code>?</code> is truly a Monad.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, in many circumstances, you don't know if a variable will
actually be the given type or not. A good example of this is with
dictionaries. <code>var a: [String: Int]</code> creates a dictionary that maps
strings to integers. If you manipulate this dictionary, and then access a
key from it, like <code>a[b]</code>, there is no way for the compiler to know if that
key will really be in the dictionary. If the key is in the dictionary, you
will get the value of that key. Otherwise, you will get <code>nil</code>. Hence, the
type of <code>a[b]</code> is <code>Int?</code>.</p>
<p>Swift uses <code>!</code> to indicate that the value is not <code>nil</code>, which tells the
compiler to compile code that doesn't check for that case.</p>
<p>For the most part, you can ignore this as well, at least when you
start. Just write code as you would, let XCode add in the types for you, and
only worry about types if the compiler tells you something is wrong.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Swift functions often require the parameters be named, for instance, you
have to write <code>CGSize(width: 1, height: 2)</code> instead of just <code>CGSize(1, 2)</code>. This is both for clarity (the former is much easier to read if you
aren't familiar with the API for <code>CGSize</code>), and because Swift allows
polymorphism, i.e., you can define different initializers for the same class
with different type signatures. For example, <code>CGRect</code> can be initialized as
<code>CGRect(origin: CGPoint, size: CGSize)</code> or <code>CGRect(x: Int, y: Int, width: Int, height: Int)</code>. This can lead to ambiguities in some cases unless you
explicitly tell the compiler which version to use.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I've found Swift to be a very strict language. I don't mean this in the sense
described by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_programming_language">this Wikipedia article</a>. What
I mean is that Swift typically only lets you do things one way.  This is
similar to Python's "one way to do it," except Swift enforces this at the
language level.</p>
<p>A nice example of this is that I rarely get a warning from the Swift compiler.
Just about every message I've gotten from the compiler has been an error. The
difference is that the program will still compile and run with a warning. This
is different from C, C++, and Objective-C, which have many warnings that the
compiler will still compile with. These warnings usually are for things like
an incorrect pointer type. Since there is really only one type in C, the
integer (because all data in memory is just integers), the program can still
run even if you mix your types up a bit.</p>
<p>There are also many cases where Swift seems maybe too strict about things,
although it's clear that it is doing it to try to stray people away from
common mistakes and antipatterns. For example, the condition of an <code>if</code>
statement in Swift must always be of type <code>Bool</code>. Unlike languages like
Python, things do not have implicit boolean values. <code>if 1</code> is a syntax
error. So is <code>if a</code> unless <code>a</code> is type <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>This ends up not being a big problem. The things Swift forces you to do feel
like good programming practices.  This is not unlike how Python "forces" you
to keep your code indented correctly.  It feels very different from a language
like Java, where the things that you are forced to do all feel like they are
there simply to make the compiler writer's life easier.  And indeed, unlike
Java and Objective-C and much like Python, Swift code requires very little
boilerplate.  There are no header files for instance.</p>
<p>So all said and done, I like Swift. I don't like it as much as Python (I also
don't have my head wrapped around it as much as Python). But it's far better
than Objective-C, and that's what matters. Frankly, my biggest gripe with it
is the ubiquitous use of CamelCasing and two letter prefixing (<code>NS</code>, <code>CG</code>,
<code>SK</code>; I don't know if there's a name for this) in the API. I adamantly refuse
to do this with my own variables, because I believe CamelCase reduces
readability over underscore_casing. I like the Python convention to use
underscore_casing for variables, functions, and methods, and CamelCase for
classes (because classes are kind of like proper nouns, and CamelCase is as
close to Capitalization as possible in programming language conventions).</p>
<h2>Learn to read Objective-C</h2>
<p>While it is not necessary to write Objective-C any more, it is a good idea to
know how to read it. The reason is that a lot of good resources on the
internet are still in Objective-C (also a lot of Apple's example
documentation). The API names are the same, so this mainly boils down to
understanding how to convert the basic syntax to Swift. Reading the section of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_C#Syntax">Wikipedia article</a> on
the syntax of Objective-C should be enough.</p>
<p>For instance</p>
<pre><code class="language-objective-c">[touch locationInNode:self]
</code></pre>
<p>would be translated to</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">touch.locationInNode(self)
</code></pre>
<h2>Use XCode</h2>
<p>If you are comfortable with the Swift language itself, you should get started
with a project.</p>
<p>First off, you should use XCode to edit your code, at least to begin with,
even if you are accustomed to using another editor.  The reason is that XCode
is going to do a lot of things for you which will make your life easier and
reduce the complexity significantly as you get started.  Once you are
comfortable, you can move to another editor.</p>
<p>Some things that XCode will do for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Autocompletion</strong>: The best way to figure out the Cocoa APIs is to use the
autocompletion. This pops up when you want to override a method in a
subclass, create an object from an existing class, access an attribute of a
class, or instantiate a class or call a function (remember that Swift is
polymorphic, so it's useful to know all the possible ways to instantiate a
class or call a function).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compiler errors and warnings</strong>: Swift, being a strictly typed language,
will give you a lot of useful compiler errors. It's pretty hard to write a
program incorrectly from a type point of view, and have it even compile.
XCode integrates this nicely, and it even offers suggestions on how to fix
things every once in a while (so that you can just click the button and have
it fixed inline).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Direct interaction with the iOS Simulator</strong>: One button will compile your code
and start the simulator. If your target is Mac OS X, it will open the
application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debugger</strong>: Clicking to the left of a line will set a breakpoint in the
debugger.  The Swift debugger seems pretty limited right now. I wasn't able
to get any useful information out of the variables view when I used it.  But
in my experience using XCode in the past to debug C, its graphical debugger
is one of the best.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration settings</strong>: If you click on the XCode project in the files
view (the root node of all the files), you get a view with all the different
settings for your project. Most of these you probably won't want to change,
but a few are important, like what devices and orientations you want to
allow, what operating system versions you want to support, and the name and
version of your project.  Editing these outside of XCode requires editing an
XML file, which is no fun.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, any editor can potentially do these things, and I'm really looking
forward to the point where I can just use Emacs to edit Swift code, as the
XCode editor as an editor is quite annoying.  XCode was the editor that I used
before I switched to using Emacs, and it's not gotten much better. There are
still several visual glitches in the editor environment, especially with the
scope coloring and syntax highlighting. You can edit the keyboard shortcuts in
the XCode setting to get some things the way you like them (although I found
that trying to set TAB to autoindent did not work). You can also use a tool
like <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a> (previously
KeyRemap4MacBook) to enable Vim or Emacs editor shortcuts everywhere
(including XCode). It doesn't help that XCode 6 is still in beta (at some
point the editor backend died and all syntax highlighting and tab completion
stopped working; I managed to fix it by removing a spurious <code>!</code> in the code)</p>
<h2>The iOS Simulator</h2>
<p>One disappointing thing that I learned is that you cannot run any iOS program
you write on an iOS device unless you are in the paid developer program (or if
you Jailbreak and are willing to go through some hoops). The iOS developer
program costs $100 a year, and since I'm not sure yet how far I am going to go
with this, I am holding off on it.</p>
<p>The only other option then is to run on the simulator. The simulator is fine,
the only issue is that there are limits to how you can simulate a touch screen
on a computer with a mouse.</p>
<p>A few things to note about the simulator:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are several things you can do with the "hardware" from the hardware
menu, such as rotating the device or pressing the home button.</p></li>
<li><p>It's worth remembering the keyboard shortcut for pressing the home button,
⇧⌘H, as you can press it twice in quick succession just like on a real
device to open the task manger. You can then drag your app up to completely
reset it, without having to restart the simulator.</p></li>
<li><p>The retina iPad is taller than your display, even if you have a 15" retina
display. So be aware that you will need to scroll up and down to see it
all. Alternately, you can use a smaller device, like an iPhone, or rotate it
to landscape, where it all fits.</p></li>
<li><p>The only way to do multitouch is to hold down the Option key. This will
create two fingers.  However, it's quite limited as the two fingers are
always centered around the center of the screen. Therefore if you want to
test multitouching two objects, you'll have to position them symmetrically so
that you can grab them both.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting started with a project</h2>
<p>The best way to start is to start a template project with XCode. I personally
started with a SpriteKit game for iOS. This created a basic template "Hello
World" Swift file with the basic <code>SKScene</code> subclass. Go ahead and compile and
run this in the simulator to see what it does.</p>
<p>There are four important methods of <code>SKScene</code> which you will want to override,
<code>didMoveToView</code>, <code>touchesBegan</code>, <code>touchesEnded</code>, and <code>update</code>. <code>didMoveToView</code>
is the initializer for the scene.  Anything that should be set up and appear
from the very beginning should go there. <code>touchesBegan</code> and <code>touchesEnded</code> are
called when a finger touches the screen and when it leaves the screen,
respectively. Remember always that iOS devices are multitouch devices, so
these events can happen concurrently, and there can be multiple touches
happening at once.  The first argument to these methods is a set of touches,
which you should iterate over to perform actions (the "Hello World" example
shows how to do this). Finally, the <code>update</code> method is called every time the
scene is updated, at each "frame" essentially.</p>
<p>There are other methods, for instance, <code>touchesMoved</code>. However, I discovered
that you don't actually want to use <code>touchesMoved</code> to do what you would think
you'd use it for, namely, to move stuff around. The reason is that there is no
easy way to sync up multitouches between <code>touchesBegan</code> (where you know what
thing the finger started on) and <code>touchesMoved</code> to move it around. It works
well for a single touch, but if you want to be able to move multiple things
around at once (which I highly recommend, as it leads to a much nicer user
experience), you have to do things a little differently, as I'll explain
below.</p>
<h2>Adding some objects to your environment</h2>
<p>There are a lot of classes to create various objects of various shapes. I
started with <code>SKSpriteNode</code>, which creates a simple square, because I wanted
to play around with touch events.</p>
<p>I started out with four sprites (yes, it would be better to put these in an
array, and probably abstract them to a method):</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">let sprite1 = SKSpriteNode(color: UIColor(red: 1.0, green: 0.0, blue: 0.0, alpha: 1.0), size: CGSize(width: 30, height: 30))
let sprite2 = SKSpriteNode(color: UIColor(red: 0.0, green: 1.0, blue: 0.0, alpha: 1.0), size: CGSize(width: 30, height: 30))
let sprite3 = SKSpriteNode(color: UIColor(red: 0.0, green: 0.0, blue: 1.0, alpha: 1.0), size: CGSize(width: 30, height: 30))
let sprite4 = SKSpriteNode(color: UIColor(red: 1.0, green: 1.0, blue: 0.0, alpha: 1.0), size: CGSize(width: 30, height: 30))
</code></pre>
<p>These lines go at the class level. This lets them be accessed from within any
method of the class.</p>
<p>One thing I could not figure out how to do was how to access class variables
from within other class variables.  In Python, you can do</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class Test:
    a = 1
    b = a + 1
</code></pre>
<p>But in Swift, if you do</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">class Test {
    let a = 1
    let b = a + 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>it tells you that <code>Test.Type does not have a member named 'a'</code> on the <code>let b = a + 1</code> line.</p>
<p>You may have to use properties with getters and setters in this case, which I
didn't feel like fooling with. The result is that I did not abstract out the
<code>CGSize(width: 30, height: 30)</code> into a common variable.</p>
<p>The <code>didMoveToView</code> method then becomes</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">override func didMoveToView(view: SKView) {
    let center = CGPoint(x:CGRectGetMidX(self.frame), y:CGRectGetMidY(self.frame))

    for s in [sprite1, sprite2, sprite3, sprite4] {
        s.position = center

        self.addChild(s)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>self.addChild</code> is the most important method here, as it actually puts the
sprite in the main view. If you forget this line, none of the sprites will
show up.</p>
<p>If you run this, you will only see the yellow box, because you put them all on
top of one another in the center of the view.</p>
<p><img src="../../galleries/swift-game-1.png" width="500"></p>
<h2>Adding Basic Physics</h2>
<p>We could change the positions so that they do not overlap, but the option I
went with was to play around with the physics a little. <code>SpriteKit</code> has a nice
2D physics engine built in, and it's quite easy to use.</p>
<p>So my final <code>didMoveToView</code> was</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">override func didMoveToView(view: SKView) {
    /* Setup your scene here */
    let center = CGPoint(x:CGRectGetMidX(self.frame), y:CGRectGetMidY(self.frame))

    for s in [sprite1, sprite2, sprite3, sprite4] {
        s.position = center

        var physics_body = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOfSize: CGSize(width: 30, height: 30))

        physics_body.affectedByGravity = false
        physics_body.allowsRotation = false

        s.physicsBody = physics_body
        self.addChild(s)
    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>For each sprite, I create an <code>SKPhysicsBody</code> with the exact same size as the
<code>SKSpriteNode</code>s (there's probably a more direct way to do this), and attach it
to that node. The <code>affectedByGravity</code> property is important. If you don't set
it to <code>false</code>, all the objects will fall off the bottom of the screen. I
disabled <code>allowsRotation</code> because I wanted my squares to stay
upright. Otherwise when when the squares hit one another they will rotate in
space.</p>
<p>Now <code>SceneKit</code> will prevent the squares from overlapping with one another, even
if we put them on top of each other as we have done.</p>
<p>So now when we start the simulator, we see</p>
<p><img src="../../galleries/swift-game-2.png" width="500"></p>
<h2>Making the squares movable</h2>
<p>Now, let's make it so that we can move these squares around.  The correct way
to do this took me some time to figure out.  I finally got some hints from
<a href="http://eppz.eu/blog/spritekit-drag/">this site</a>.</p>
<p>The key thing here is that the <code>UITouch</code> objects remain the same objects for
the duration of the touch. Their position is updated when the touch
moves. Hence, you just need to associate each touch with the node that was
touched when the touch began, and move the node to the position of that touch
with each update.</p>
<p>To start, we will create a dictionary on the class mapping touches to nodes</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">var selected: [UITouch: SKNode] = [:]
</code></pre>
<p>Then, in the <code>touchesBegan</code> method, map every touch to the node that it
touches.</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">override func touchesBegan(touches: NSSet, withEvent event: UIEvent) {
    /* Called when a touch begins */

    selected = [:]
    for touch: AnyObject in touches {
        let location = touch.locationInNode(self)

        selected[touch as UITouch] = nodeAtPoint(location)

    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>as UITouch</code> part is needed because the compiler only knows that touch is
<code>AnyObject</code>. This was one of the things that was helpfully suggested by the
compiler, so I did not really need to know what I was doing to get it right.</p>
<p>Note that even if you touch the background behind the squares, you are still
touching a node, namely, the <code>GameScene</code> node itself (the node for the class
you are working on).  This is a very important observation, as it will tell us
how to get the right position for the node when we update it. It also means
that we should keep track of which nodes we actually want to be moved by the
touch. Trying to move the <code>GameScene</code> node is ignored, at leads to a lot of
console logs, so we should avoid it.</p>
<p>Next, let's write the <code>touchesEnded</code> method. This method is simple. If a touch
ends (the finger is removed from the screen), we should remove it from the
<code>selected</code> dictionary.</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">override func touchesEnded(touches: NSSet, withEvent event: UIEvent) {
    for touch: AnyObject in touches {
    selected[touch as UITouch] = nil
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>To delete an item from a dictionary in Swift, just set it to <code>nil</code>.</p>
<p>Now, finally, we need to write the <code>update</code> method to move the node to the
current position of the touch.</p>
<p>The simplest way to do this is</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">override func update(currentTime: CFTimeInterval) {
    /* Called before each frame is rendered */
    for (touch, node) in selected {
        if !contains([sprite1, sprite2, sprite3, sprite4], node) {
            continue
        }
        let location = touch.locationInNode(self)
        node.position = location
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we only modify the position for the four sprite nodes.</p>
<p>The <code>touch.locationInNode(self)</code> part took me a long time to figure out. There
are other methods, like <code>touch.locationInView(nil)</code>, but this does something
very strange where the the horizontal axis was doubled (moving the touch one
inch moved the object two inches), and the vertical axis was inverted. If
someone knows what was going on there, please let me know.</p>
<p>Modifying the position directly is nice, but it's nice to play around a little
bit with a third thing from SpriteKit, actions.</p>
<p>What we will do instead of setting the position of the node is to tell
SpriteKit to move the node there in a certain amount of time. If we make this
time small enough, like <code>0.01</code> seconds, it will appear to act exactly the
same. If we up this time, there will be a smooth "lag" where the node catches
up to the touch. Because the movement always happens in the same amount of
time, it will move faster if the finger is farther away. This gives the
squares a nice "frictioney" effect with some springiness to it, which is quite
nice.</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">override func update(currentTime: CFTimeInterval) {

            continue
        }

<p>There are many other actions we can perform, like rotations and color
changes.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Here is an example of the movement. You can see it works even with
multitouch.  You can also see the collision physics cause the other squares to
move out of the way when another square hits them.</p>

</video><p>Here you can see the movement lag caused by using <code>SKAction.moveTo</code> with
<code>duration: 0.1</code> (note that the mouse itself jumps a bit at the beginning, but
this is due to lag in the recording).</p>

<p>This isn't exactly a "game", but it does lay down the foundations for what you
would need to write a game in Swift using SpriteKit.  At least for me, it
shows me the technical basics of how to write some games that I had thought
about, which mostly involve making shapes and moving them around the screen.</p>
