<p>I just finished <a href="https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/">SciPy 2014</a>, a
week-long conference in Austin, TX for scientific computing with Python.</p>
<p>This is my third SciPy (I have been to
<a href="https://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/the-scipy-2011-conference/">2011</a>
and <a href="https://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/scipy-2013/">2013</a>). This
year, the conference was noticeably larger. Last year there were
<a href="http://andy.terrel.us/blog/2013/07/05/scipy2013-recap/">~350 people</a>, this
year, there were
<a href="https://twitter.com/scopatz/status/488370261150818304">~450 people</a>.  Aside
from there being a lot more people, and the main keynotes taking place in a
larger room, the most noticeable consequence of this is that there were three
days of talks this year, and three concurrent tracks of talks all three days
(last year there were two of each). The conference consisted of two days of
tutorials, three days of talks, and two days of sprints, running from July 5
to July 12.</p>
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>The conference started on Sunday with tutorials. I gave a tutorial on SymPy
with <a href="http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/">Matthew Rocklin</a> and
<a href="http://www.moorepants.info/blog/">Jason Moore</a>. The videos are on YouTube
(parts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgp442bibDM">one</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PTe10whFKo">two</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleGSnrnxgc">three</a>, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04AGOl1P2U4">four</a>).  I gave tutorials for
SymPy the previous two times I was at SciPy, although with different people
(with Mateusz Paprocki in 2011 and
<a href="http://ondrejcertik.blogspot.com/">Ondřej Čertík</a> in 2013). I really enjoy
seeing new people learn about SymPy, and working with Matthew Rocklin, who is
a very good speaker and teacher.</p>
<p>I also attended the tutorial on PyDy by Jason Moore, Gilbert Gede, and
Obinna Nwanna (parts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWbeuDwYVto">one</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-KqRvNX0po">two</a>).  This tutorial was
also well done, and I highly recommend it if you are interested in Newtonian
mechanics.</p>
<p>I unfortunately was unable to attend any of the other tutorials, but I heard
good things about them, especially the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkgEddb4-A">Julia tutorial</a>.</p>
<h2>Talks</h2>
<p>From Tuesday to Thursday were talks. The quality of talks this year was very
high. The SciPy talks have always been high quality talks, but this year I
felt that they were particularly good. I don't think I saw a bad talk.</p>
<p>Thus, I can't really recommend the good talks that I saw without recommending
all of them. You should go to YouTube and the
<a href="https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/schedule/">SciPy schedule</a> and watch
any talk that looks interesting.</p>
<p>I therefore am going to recommend here the very best talks.  Two talks in
particular stood out to me as the best.</p>
<p>First is Greg Wilson's Thursday keynote, which is among the best talks I've
ever seen from any conference.</p>
<p></p>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1e26rp6qPbA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p>Greg mentions a lot of ideas, quite a few of which are controversial, which I
think always makes for an interesting talk (it also means that I don't agree
with everything he said, although I do agree with most of it). Most of the
talk is about pedagogy, especially regarding his experiences at
<a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>. Some things he posited:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is actually good research about what methods work and don't work in
  teaching. He referenced
  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/richardcookau/john-hattie-effect-sizes-on-achievement">this presentation</a>,
  which lists just about every possible pedagogical method, and the net
  difference that it has on students, based on over 50,000 studies. For
  example, individualized instruction has a very small positive effect,
  whereas teacher feedback has a very large positive effect. Since each takes
  time and resources, we should focus on those effects that have the highest
  impact. Greg pointed out that web-based learning has very little positive
  effect, and hence is a waste of time and money. The most effective change is
  removing disruptive students.</p>
<p>In particular, I liked the quote, "if you want more computing in high
school, you have to tell me what to take out."  People like to go on that
schools need to teach more of this or more of that, and computing and
programming tends to be high on that list these days, but anyone who does
not discuss what things should be removed from the curriculum, which is
already quite full, is not being honest about the discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other big point Greg made is that we need more incremental massive
  collaboration in teaching. This is the same model that has built open source
  and Wikipedia, but is mostly absent from teaching. Incremental change is
  important here, as well. It is more useful for someone to contribute fixes
  to existing lesson plans, so that they become better for the students, but
  in his experience, people are much more willing to add new lessons.  Greg
  calls for a "culture of patching". If incremental change could be adopted in
  teaching, teachers could aggregate methods and lesson plans, removing the
  massive duplication, and most importantly, making teaching materials that
  actually work for students to learn. Greg Wilson asks why open source and
  Wikipedia are able to thrive on massive <em>incremental</em> change, but teaching
  is not, a question he hasn't found the answer to.</p>
<p>My thought on the matter is that unlike writing software or collecting and
presenting facts, pedagogy is very difficult. If I contribute a patch to
an open source project that fixes a bug, I can run the tests to see if my
fix is "correct". If I fix an incorrect fact on Wikipedia, it is less
easy, but I can still cite and check references to make sure it is
correct.  But for teaching, it is very difficult to know what methods work
and what don't, and as Greg pointed out at the beginning of his talk, the
effects of different methods can be very counterintuitive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second talk that I recommend is
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/">Jake VanderPlas</a>'s talk about Frequentism and
Bayesianism.</p>
<p></p>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KhAUfqhLakw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p>I won't summarize this talk, as Jake has done a much better job in his blog
(parts
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/frequentism-and-bayesianism-a-practical-intro/">one</a>,
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/06/frequentism-and-bayesianism-2-when-results-differ/">two</a>,
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/12/frequentism-and-bayesianism-3-confidence-credibility/">three</a>,
and
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/14/frequentism-and-bayesianism-4-bayesian-in-python/">four</a>). The
best thing is to just watch the talk.  I will just point out that before the
talk, I did not really understand the difference, not being a statistician or
someone who works with statistics regularly, and having seen the talk, I now
feel that I do.  It's a controversial topic, and if you care about the matter,
you should know that Jake is a strong Bayesian, although I felt that he gave
both sides a fair exposition.</p>
<p>Again, all talks I saw at the conference were good. But those two I felt were
the best. I should also mention here that I myself gave a talk on Conda (more
on that later).</p>
<h2>The Conference</h2>
<p>Of course, the talks are only a part of any conference. The best part of SciPy
is the gathering of the community. Each year I meet more new people, as well
as talk with people I already know, but don't get to see outside of SciPy.</p>
<p>For me, the biggest part of the interactions this year were on Conda and
packaging.  The background is that I have been working full time for Continuum
since January, and I had interned last summer, working primarily on the Conda
package manager and Anaconda, the Python distribution.  This year, some of the
biggest buzz at the conference was about Conda. I'm obviously selection
biased, because people came to me specifically to talk about Conda, but I also
overheard it in other people's conversations, in several of the presentations,
and frankly, the people who did talk to me about Conda were <em>very</em> excited
about it.  Just like everyone was talking about the IPython Notebook last year
and how it has solved the fundamental problems of sharing and presenting data
analysis, this year, everyone thanked me for my work on Conda and how it has
basically solved the packaging problem, the ubiquitous problem in Python since
people started using it.</p>
<h3>Conda: The Packaging Problem Solved</h3>
<p>Here is the talk I gave on Conda:</p>
<p></p>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UaIvrDWrIWM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p>I made the claim in my talk that Conda has solved the packaging problem, and
the general feel from people I talked to who are using Conda is that it has.</p>
<p>I think this slide from my presentation summarizes why Conda solves the
packaging problem.</p>
<p><img src="../../galleries/conda_scipy2014_slide.png" width="500"></p>
<p>One of the most amazing things about the scientific Python community, and one
of the things that I think really sets it apart from other Python communities,
is the use of Python alongside other languages, such as C, C++, Fortran, R, or
Julia.  No one language is enough to get the job done for serious scientific
work.  The fundamental brokenness of Python packaging has been that it has
focused too much on Python specific tools and processes.  The
distutils/setuptools/pip/virtualenv stack works great if your code begins and
ends with Python.  Where it falls over is when you want to link against a C
library, compile some Fortran or Cython code, and communicate with other
languages like R and Julia.  By being a system level package manager, which is
fundamentally Python agnostic, Conda is able to deal with all packages
equally, whether that package be a Python package, a C extension which other
packages link against, or Python itself.</p>
<p>By being truly cross-platform and user installable, Conda is able to reach the
maximal number of users, especially those who have historically been hit by
the packaging problem the hardest:  those who are on Windows or those who do
not have admin rights to install necessary tools to install the packages they
need.</p>
<p>Finally, Conda installs binaries, not source packages, and its metadata is
entirely static (you do not need to execute arbitrary Python code to capture
the metadata of a package).  These two things remove two of the largest
sources of issues with the existing Python packaging tools, such as compiler
errors, and nonuniformity in metadata standards (there seem to be as many
different ways of writing <code>setup.py</code> as there are packages on PyPI), by
removing arbitrary code execution from package installation.</p>
<p>Conda opens up its ecosystem to anybody by making it easy for people to build
their own Conda packages using reproducible Conda recipes.  And
<a href="https://binstar.org/">Binstar</a> makes it easy to share those packages.  I'm
very excited about Binstar, as I think it does for packaging what GitHub has
done for open source, i.e., distributes and democratizes it. There are
challenges on how to deal with this, of course. As with any distributed
democratized system, Binstar can be a wild west of packages.  Continuum is
thinking about ways to manage this complexity, while still reaping the
benefits it provides. If you have any thoughts on things that can be done, let
me know in the comments section below.</p>
<p>Of course, solving the packaging problem and removing it are different
things.  Conda does not make it easier to compile difficult packages.  It only
makes it so that fewer people have to do it.  And there is still work to be
done before Conda really takes over the world.</p>
<h2>Sprints</h2>
<p>The conference ended with two days of sprints. I mainly helped people with
Conda packaging.  One key thing that happened is that I worked with Aron
Ahmadia so that HashDist can generate Conda
packages. <a href="http://hashdist.github.io/">HashDist</a> is a package compiling
framework that makes it easy to have completely reproducible builds by hashing
all the information that was used to compile a package, and recompiling when
any of that information changes. You can learn more about HashDist by watching
Aron's talk from the conference:</p>
<p></p>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wviHkzk0AkY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p>I am now convinced that HashDist is a good solution for people who still want
the control of compiling their own packages. Once HashDist is able to produce
Conda packages, then you can gain the benefits of both worlds: Conda's
powerful package management and environment notion, with HashDist's modular
and reproducible package building framework.</p>
<h2>Other thoughts</h2>
<p>The organizers of SciPy did an excellent job this year.  The video crew did
something which I have not seen before, which is that they uploaded the videos
of the talks on the same day that the talks were held. My talk, which was held
right before lunch, was uploaded before the last talk of the day.  Something
that I saw come out of this is that people not attending the conference were
able to watch the talks and take part of the conversation with the conference
attendees, via Twitter and other social media, or by joining the sprints after
the conference.</p>
<p>The extended three days of talks really took their toll on me. The conference
starts early enough in the morning and the social events after go so late in
the evening that each day of the conference I become a little more sleep
deprived. Usually by two days of tutorials and two days of talks I have hit my
limit, and this year, I really had a hard time making it through that fifth
day. Fortunately for the sprints I was able sleep in a little bit, as it's not
a big deal if you miss the beginning.</p>
<p>This year the conference organizers made a push for diversity, and it
shows. There were noticeably more women at the conference this year, and not
just insomuch as there were more people at all.</p>
<p>Finally, I leave you with the greatest lightening talk. Ever.</p>
