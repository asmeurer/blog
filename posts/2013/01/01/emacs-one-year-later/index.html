<p>As read­ers of this blog may re­mem­ber, back in 2011, I de­cid­ed to move to a com­mand-­line based ed­i­tor. For rough­ly two weeks in De­cem­ber, 2011, I ex­clu­sive­ly used Vim, and for the same amount of time in Jan­uary, 2012, I used ex­clu­sive­ly Emac­s. I had used a lit­tle of each ed­i­tor in the past, but this was my first time us­ing them to do true edit­ing work. My ex­pe­ri­ences are chron­i­cled in my blog posts (parts  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/vim-vs-emacs-part-1/" title="1">1</a>,  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/vim-vs-emacs-part-2/" title="2">2</a>,  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3/" title="3">3</a>, and  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/emacs-7-months-later/" title="7 months later follow up">7 months lat­er fol­low up</a>).   </p> 
 <p>To sum­ma­rize, I de­cid­ed to use Emac­s, as I found it to be much more in­tu­itive, and much more user-friend­ly.  To­day, Jan­u­ary 1, marks the one-year point of my us­ing Emacs as my sole text ed­i­tor, with some ex­cep­tions (no­tably, I'm cur­rent­ly writ­ing this blog post in the browser).  So I'd like to make some ob­ser­va­tion­s:</p> 
 <div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;</span>Either one of these editors (Vim or Emacs) is going to really suck unless you are willing to make a serious investment in customizing them and installing nice addons. For the second point, Emacs has an advantage, because the philosophy of Vim is to be barebones whereas the philosophy of Emacs is to be featureful, so that in particular many things that were once addons of Emacs are now included in the standard installation.  For customization, on the one hand, Emacs is easier, because it has a nice interface (<span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-x customize<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>), but on the other hand, Vim's scripting language is much easier to hack on than Emacs lisp (I still can't code in Lisp to save my life; it's a very challenging programming language).<span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>But my point here is that neither has really great defaults. For example, in Emacs, <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-space<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> is bound to <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>just-one-space<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, which is great for programming.  What it does is remove all spaces around the cursor, except for one.  But to be really useful, it also should include newlines.  It doesn't do this by default.  Rather, you have to call it with a negative argument.  So to be really useful, you have to add
</pre></div>


<p>[source­code]</p> 
 <p>(de­fun just-one-s­pace-with­-new­line ()
  "Call just-one-s­pace with a neg­a­tive ar­gu­men­t"
  (in­ter­ac­tive)
  (just-one-s­pace -1))</p> 
 <p>(glob­al-set-key (kbd "M-SPC") 'just-one-s­pace-with­-new­line)</p> 
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~</p> 
 <p>to your  <code>.emacs</code>  file.</p> 
 <div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Emacs has great features, but I always have to look them up.  Or rather, I have to look up the keyboard shortcuts for them.  I only have the keyboard shortcuts memorized for the things I do every day.  I even ended up forgetting really important ones, like <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-w<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> (Emacs version of copy).  And if a feature involves several keystrokes to access, forget about it (for example, rectangular selection, or any features of special modes).  If I use a new mode, e.g., for some file type that I rarely edit (like HTML), I might as well not have any of the features, other than the syntax highlighting, because I either don't know what they are, or even if I know that they should exist (like automatic tag completion for html), I have no idea how to access them. <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There's re­al­ly some­thing to be said about GUI ed­i­tors, which give these things to users in a way that they don't have to mem­o­rize any­thing.  Per­haps I should try to use the menu more.  Or maybe au­thors of ad­dons should aim to make fea­tures re­quire as lit­tle cog­ni­tive us­er in­ter­ac­tion as pos­si­ble (such as the ex­cel­lent  <a href="http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/manual.html"><code>au­to-­com­plete-­mode</code></a>  I men­tioned in  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3/">part 3</a>).</p> 
 <p><br><br>  I men­tion this be­cause it is one of the things I com­plained about with Vim, that the key­bind­ings were too hard to mem­o­rize.  Of course, the dif­fer­ence with Vim is that one has to mem­o­rize key­bind­ings to do even the most ba­sic of edit­ing tasks, where­as with Emacs one can al­ways fall back to more nat­u­ral things like  <code>Shift-Ar­row Key</code>  to se­lect text or  <code>Delete</code>  to delete the char­ac­ter un­der the cur­sor (and yes, I know you can re­bind this stuff in Vim; I re­fer you to the pre­vi­ous bul­let point).  </p> 
 <div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I mentioned at the end of part 3 that Vim might still be useful to learn, as vi is available literally anywhere that you have POSIX.  I honestly don't think I would be able to use vi or vim if I had to, customization or no, unless I had my keyboard cheat sheet and a decent amount of time.  If I'm stuck on a barebones system and I can't do anything about it, I'll use nano/pico before I use vi.  It's not that I hate vi. I just can't do anything with it. It is the same to me now as it was before I used it in-depth.  I have forgotten all the keyboard shortcuts, except for <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>ESC<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> and <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>i<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I don't use <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>emacsclient<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> any more.  Ever since I got my new retina MacBook Pro, I don't need it any more, because with the solid state drive starting Emacs from scratch is instantaneous.  I'm glad to get rid of it, because it had some seriously annoying glitches.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Add <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>alias e=emacs<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> to your Bash config file (<span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>.profile<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> or <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>.bashrc<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>). It makes life much easier. "emacs" is not an easy word to type, at least on QWERTY keyboards.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I still feel like I am not nearly as efficient in Emacs as I could be. On the one hand, I know there are built-in features (like rectangular selection) that I do not take advantage of enough.  I have been a bit lazy with customization: there are a handful of things that I do often that require several keystrokes, but I still haven't created custom keyboard shortcuts for (off the top of my head: copying and pasting to/from the Mac OS X clipboard and rigidly indenting/dedenting a block of text (<span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-u 4 C-x TAB<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, actually <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-c u 4 C-x TAB<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, since I did the sensible thing and rebound <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-u<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> to clear to the previous newline, and bound <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>universal-argument<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> to <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-c u<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>) come to mind). <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>I feel as if I were to watch someone who has used Emacs for a long time that I would learn a lot of tricks.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I really should learn Emacs lisp. There are a lot of little customizations that I would like to make, but they are really niche, and can only be done programmatically.  But who has the time to learn a completely new programming language (plus a whole library, as just knowing Lisp is useless if you don't know the proper Emacs funtions and variables and coding styles)?<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>



<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I've still not found a good visual browser for jumping to function definitions in a file (mostly Python function definitions, but also other kinds of headers for other kinds of files).  The best I've found is <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>imenu<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>. If you know of anything, please let me know.  One thing I really liked about Vim was the <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>tag list<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> extension, which did this perfectly (thanks to commenter <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/vim-vs-emacs-part-1/#comment-424"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Scott<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> for pointing it out to me).  I've been told that Cedet has something like this, but every time I try to install it, I run into some issues that just seem like way too much work (I don't remember what they are, it won't compile or something, or maybe it just wants to do just way too much and I can't figure out how to disable everything except for the parts I want).  <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you ever code in C, add the following to your Makefile
</pre></div>


<p>[code]</p> 
 <p>check­-syn­tax:
    $(C­C) -o nul $(FLAGS) -S $(CHK_­SOURCES)
[/­code]</p> 
 <p>(and if you don't use a Make­file, start us­ing one now).  This is as­sum­ing you have  <code>CC</code>  and  <code>FLAGS</code>  de­fined at the top (gen­er­al­ly to some­thing like  <code>cc</code>  and  <code>-Wall</code>, re­spec­tive­ly). Al­so, add the fol­low­ing to your  <code>.emacs</code></p> 
 <p>[code]</p> 
 <p>;; ===== Turn on fly­make-­mode ====</p> 
 <p>(ad­d-hook 'c-­mod­e-­com­mon-hook 'turn-on-fly­make)</p> 
 <p>(de­fun turn-on-fly­make ()
  "Force fly­make-­mode on. For use in hook­s."

 <p>(ad­d-hook 'c-­mod­e-­com­mon-hook 'fly­make-key­board­-short­cut­s)</p>

  (lo­cal-set-key "\M-p" 'fly­make-­go­to-pre­v-er­ror))
[/­code]</p> 
 <p>The last part adds the use­ful key­board short­cuts  <code>M-n</code>  and  <code>M-p</code>  to move be­tween er­rors.  Now, er­rors in your C code will show up au­to­mat­i­cal­ly as you type.  If you use the com­mand line ver­sion of emacs like I do, and not the GUI ver­sion, you'll al­so need to in­stall the  <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/flymake-cursor.el">fly­make-cur­sor</a>  mod­ule, which makes the er­rors show up in the mode line, since oth­er­wise it tries to use mouse pop­up­s.  You can change the col­ors us­ing  <code>M-x cus­tomize-­face</code>  (search for "fly­make").  </p> 
 <div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I never got flymake to work with LaTeX.  Does anyone know how to do it? It seems it is hardcoded to use MikTeX, the Windows version of LaTeX. I found some stuff, but none of it worked.  <span class="nt">&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Ac­tu­al­ly, what I re­al­ly would like is not syn­tax check­ing (I rarely make syn­tax mis­takes in La­TeX any more), but rather some­thing that au­to­mat­i­cal­ly builds the PDF con­stant­ly as I type.  That way, I can just look over at the PDF as I am writ­ing (I use an ex­ter­nal mon­i­tor for this. I high­ly rec­om­mend it if you use La­TeX, es­pe­cial­ly one of those mon­i­tors that swivels to por­trait mod­e).   </p> 
 <div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you use Mac OS X, you can use the very excellent <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>KeyRemap4MacBook<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> program to make regular Mac OS X programs act more like Emacs.  Mac OS X already has many Emacs shortcuts built in (like <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-a<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-e<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, etc.), but that only works in Cocoa apps, and it doesn't include any meta key shortcuts.  This lets you use additional shortcuts literally everywhere (don't worry, it automatically doesn't use them in the Terminal), including an emulator for <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-space<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> and some <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-x<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> commands (like <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-x C-s<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> to <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>Command-s<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>).  It doesn't work on context sensitive shortcuts, unfortunately, unless the operating system already supports it with another keyboard shortcut (e.g., it can map <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-f<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> to <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>Option-right arrow<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>).  For example, it can't enable moving between paragraphs with <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-S-{<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> and <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-S-}<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>.  If anyone knows how to do that, let me know. <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>For about a month this summer, I had to use a Linux laptop, because my Mac broke and my new Mac took a month to arrive (the downside to ordering a new computer immediately after it is announced by Apple).  At this point, my saving of all my customizations to <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>GitHub<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> really helped a lot.  I created a new branch for the Linux computer (because several things in my customizations were Mac specific), and just symlinked the files I wanted.  A hint I can give to people using Linux is to use Konsole.  The Gnome terminal sucks.  One thing I never figured out is how to make Konsole (or any other Terminal for that matter) to send Control-Shift shortcuts to Emacs (see http://superuser.com/q/439961/39697).   I don't use Linux any more at the moment, but if anyone knows what was going on there, add an answer to that question. <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>In <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3/"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>part 3<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> mentioned that <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.dr-qubit.org/predictive/predictive-user-manual/html/index.php"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>predictive mode<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> was cool, but not very useful.  What it does is basically add tab completion for every word in the English language.  Actually, I've found using auto-complete-mode even when editing text (or LaTeX) to be very useful.  Unlike predictive mode, it only guesses words that you've already typed  (it turns out that you tend to type the same words over and over, and doubly so if those words are LaTeX math commands).  Also, predictive mode has a set order of words, which supposedly helps to use it with muscle memory, whereas auto-complete-mode tries to learn what words you are more likely to use based on some basic statistical machine-learning.  Also, auto-complete-mode has a much better visual UI and smarter defaults than predictive mode. The result is that it's actually quite useful and makes typing plain text, as well as LaTeX (actually, pretty much anything, as long as you tend to use the same words repeatedly) much faster.  I recommend enabling auto-complete-mode almost everywhere using hooks, like

 <div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>At the end of the day, I'm pretty happy with Emacs.  I've managed to fix most of the things that make it annoying, and it is orders of magnitude more powerful than any GUI editor or IDE I've ever seen, especially at just basic text editing, which is the most important thing (I can always use another program for other things, like debugging or whatever).  The editor uses the basic shortcuts that I am used to, and is quite efficient to write in.  Extensions like auto-complete-mode make using it much faster, though I could use some more extensions to make it even better (namely, a better isearch and a better imenu). Regarding Vim vs. Emacs, I'd like to quote something I said back in my <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/vim-vs-emacs-part-1"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>first blog post<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> about Vim over a year ago:
</pre></div>


<blockquote>Vim is great for text <em>editing</em>, but not so hot for text <em>writing</em> (unless you always write text perfectly, so that you never need to leave insert mode until you are done typing). Just the simple act of deleting a mistyped word (yes, word, that happens a lot when you are decently fast touch typist) takes several keystrokes, when it should in my opinion only take one (two if you count the meta-key).</blockquote>

<p>Need­less to say, I find Emacs to be great for both text edit­ing and text writ­ing.  </p>
