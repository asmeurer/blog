    <div><p></p><p>This past week was the 2013 SciPy con­fer­ence. It was an ex­cit­ing time, and a lot of in­ter­est­ing things hap­pened.  </p><p>First, a back­ground. This sum­mer, I have been do­ing an in­tern­ship with  <a href="http://continuum.io/">Con­tin­u­um An­a­lyt­ics</a>. There I have been work­ing main­ly on Ana­con­da and con­da. Ana­con­da is Con­tin­u­um's free (to ev­ery­one) Python dis­tri­bu­tion, which makes it re­al­ly easy to get boot­strapped with all the sci­en­tif­ic soft­ware (in­clud­ing SymPy). Con­da is Ana­con­da's pack­age man­ager, which, I think, solves many if not all of the main is­sues with the Python pack­ag­ing tools like pip, easy_in­stal­l, PyP­I, and vir­tualen­v.  </p><p>I may write more about that lat­er, but for now, I want to write about my ex­pe­ri­ences at the con­fer­ence. The main point there is that I have al­ready been in Austin for about a mon­th, so get­ting to the con­fer­ence this year was pret­ty easy.</p><p>On the first day of the con­fer­ence, on Mon­day morn­ing, On­drej Cer­tik and I had our tu­to­ri­al for SymPy. For the past cou­ple of month­s, I have been rewrit­ing the of­fi­cial SymPy tu­to­ri­al from scratch. The of­fi­cial tu­to­ri­al for SymPy was very old, and had many is­sues. It on­ly went over fea­tures that were good at the time of its writ­ing, so while noth­ing in the tu­to­ri­al was wrong, it did­n't re­al­ly rep­re­sent the lat­est and great­est of the li­brary. Al­so, it was writ­ten just like a list of ex­am­ples, which is not much more than the API doc­s. In my new tu­to­ri­al, I aimed to give a nar­ra­tive style doc­u­men­ta­tion, which starts from the very be­gin­ning of what sym­bol­ics are and works its way up to the ba­sic func­tion­al­i­ty of things like solv­ing and sim­pli­fy­ing ex­pres­sion­s. My goal was al­so to lead by ex­am­ple, and in par­tic­u­lar, to avoid teach­ing things that I think ei­ther are an­tipat­tern­s, or lead to an­tipat­tern­s. In Python, there is one-- and prefer­ably on­ly one --way to do it. In SymPy, by the na­ture of the li­brary, there are about sev­en dif­fer­ent ways to cre­ate a Sym­bol, for ex­am­ple (see http­s://github.­com/sympy/sympy/wik­i/Id­iom­s-and-An­tipat­tern­s, the sec­tion, "Cre­at­ing Sym­bol­s"). But there is one  <em>best</em>  way to do it: by us­ing sym­bol­s(). So all through­out the tu­to­ri­al, I just use sym­bol­s(), even if I am cre­at­ing a sin­gle Sym­bol. I avoid messy things like var.  </p><p>The fi­nal tu­to­ri­al is at http://­doc­s.sympy.org/­tu­to­ri­al/­tu­to­ri­al/. This was the ba­sis for the tu­to­ri­al that On­drej and I gave at SciPy. The site for our tu­to­ri­al is at http://cer­tik.github.io/s­cipy-2013-­tu­to­ri­al/htm­l/in­dex.htm­l. There are links to videos, slides, and ex­er­cise note­books there.  </p><p>I think our tu­to­ri­al was a great suc­cess. Peo­ple liked (I think) the in­tro­duc­tion from noth­ing to SymPy. For our ex­er­cis­es, we used the  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipython_doctester">IPython Doctester</a>. I think that peo­ple re­al­ly liked this way of do­ing ex­er­cis­es, but there were some is­sues get­ting it to work on ev­ery­one's ma­chine.  </p><p>In ad­di­tion to my stuff, On­drej pre­sent­ed some note­books of ex­am­ples of work that he has used in his work at LAN­L. I think this worked well. There were sev­er­al physi­cists in the au­di­ence, who un­der­stood most of the con­tent, but even for those who weren't (in­clud­ing me!), it re­al­ly showed that SymPy is a use­ful tool. In a be­gin­ner tu­to­ri­al, it is easy to get lost in the easy de­tail­s, and for­get that in the end, you can ac­tu­al­ly use SymPy to com­pute some pow­er­ful things.  SymPy has in the past year or two re­al­ly passed the bar­ri­er of toy to tool.  </p><p>Af­ter our tu­to­ri­al, I at­tend­ed the IPython tu­to­ri­al, and the two-­part Scik­it-Learn tu­to­ri­al. The most awe­some part of this was just get­ting to meet peo­ple. Fer­nan­do Perez, Thomas Kluyver, and Bri­an Granger of IPython were at the con­fer­ence. Brain is al­so a SymPy de­vel­op­er, who has spear­head­ed the quan­tum mod­ule. From SymPy, in ad­di­tion to On­drej (who cre­at­ed SymPy), I met Matthew Rock­lin, one of the top con­trib­u­tors, Ja­son Moore, one of the de­vel­op­ers of Py­Dy, which us­es SymPy's me­chan­ics mod­ule, and David Li, who works on SymPy Gam­ma and SymPy Live (more on these peo­ple lat­er).  </p><p>Af­ter the tu­to­ri­al­s, Wednes­day and Thurs­day were the talk­s. There were a lot of good ones. Here are the ones that I re­mem­ber the most</p><ul><li>Fer­nan­do's key­note. If you've ev­er seen one of Fer­nan­do's talk­s, you know that he is a great speak­er.  </li><li>Matthew's talk. His talk was about his work on us­ing SymPy's ma­trix ex­pres­sions to com­pile ex­pres­sions for BLAS/LA­PACK. This talk ex­cit­ed many peo­ple in the au­di­ence. I think this is great, be­cause it shows peo­ple some of the re­al pow­er of things you can on­ly do with sym­bol­ic­s.</li><li>Ja­son Moore's talk about Py­Dy and the me­chan­ics mod­ule. He ran out of time, but there is a nice ex­am­ple of us­ing SymPy to gen­er­ate a con­troller for an in­vert­ed triple pen­du­lum, which seems im­pos­si­ble, but then he shows a video of an ac­tu­al thing that can do it.</li><li>William Schroed­er's key­note. The mes­sage was that the aca­dem­ic mod­el is bro­ken, and does­n't lead to re­pro­ducible re­search. While they are fix­ing things, the mes­sage is that we are the new pub­lish­er­s. There was al­so men­tion at the end that we should stop us­ing non­com­mer­cial li­cens­es, and stop us­ing vi­ral li­cens­es like the GPL and LGPL. I was a lit­tle sur­prised to hear such a con­tro­ver­sial state­men­t, but it's ac­tu­al­ly very true, and I agree with him that if peo­ple don't stop us­ing the GPL, then we will nev­er achieve open­ness in sci­ence.  </li><li>David Li's talk. David Li is a high school stu­dent (s­tart­ing his se­nior year in the fal­l), who start­ed with SymPy two years ago with Google Code-In. He has con­tin­ued work­ing on  <a href="http://live.sympy.org/">SymPy Live</a>, and  <a href="http://gamma.sympy.org/">SymPy Gam­ma</a>  since. He is the rea­son that we have  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/sympy-live-sphinx-extension/">SymPy Live in our docs</a>. His talk was al­so well re­ceived.  ­David is a good speak­er, and SymPy Gam­ma and SymPy Live are pret­ty cool (for those of you who don't know, SymPy Live is an on­line shell where you can run a Python ses­sion with SymPy in the browser, and SymPy Gam­ma is the SymPy ver­sion of Wol­fra­mAl­pha).</li><li>Bri­an Granger's talk. His talk is en­ti­tled "<strong><a href="http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/presentation_detail.php?id=195">Why you should write bug­gy soft­ware with as few fea­tures as pos­si­ble</a>".  </strong>I think he had some good mes­sages in there. You have to re­duce the scope of your pro­jec­t, or it will get out of hand. As for bugs, get­ting bug re­ports is a good thing, be­cause it shows that peo­ple are us­ing the soft­ware, and what parts of it they are us­ing.  </li><li>The light­ning talk­s. Es­pe­cial­ly Matthew Rock­lin's light­ning talk. His talk was about split­ting things up in­to very small pack­ages, so that you don't have to get a huge pack­age just for one func­tion. He went a lit­tle far with it, and I think his ideas aren't re­al­ly us­able in the cur­rent Python pack­ag­ing ecosys­tem, but, tak­en in mod­er­a­tion, I agree with him. At any rate, it was very en­ter­tain­ing (I don't have any video links here be­cause they aren't post­ed yet, but I en­cour­age you to watch the light­ning talks once they are post­ed).  </li><li>I heard the mat­plotlib talk was good, but I haven't seen it be­cause it was at the same time as Matthew's talk. I plan to watch it when the videos come out. If you saw it, I en­cour­age you to watch Matthew's talk, es­pe­cial­ly if you've ev­er used BLAS/LA­PACK.</li></ul><p>Top­ping off the week were the sprints on Fri­day and Sat­ur­day. My goal was to get out a re­lease of SymPy. We did­n't quite get that far, but we got close. We are on­ly block­ing on a few small things to get out a re­lease can­di­date, so ex­pect one be­fore the end of the week. We did in­tro­duce a lot of peo­ple to SymPy at the sprints, though, and got some first time con­tri­bu­tion­s. Def­i­nite­ly I think we made a lot more peo­ple aware of SymPy at this con­fer­ence than we ev­er have be­fore.  </p><p>An­oth­er in­ter­est­ing thing at the sprints: be­fore the con­fer­ence, I was telling David Li that we should switch to Dill for SymPy Live (the way SymPy Live works on the App En­gine, it has to pick­le the ses­sion be­tween run­s, be­cause there is a 60 time lim­it on each ex­e­cu­tion). Dill is a li­brary that ex­tends Python's pick­le so that it can pick­le just about any­thing. At the end of David's talk, the guy who wrote Dil­l, Mike McK­ern­s raised his hand and asked him about it! At the sprints, David and he worked to­geth­er to get it work­ing in SymPy Live (and co­in­ci­den­tal­ly, he al­so us­es SymPy in an­oth­er pack­age, mys­tic). There were some fix­es need­ed for Dil­l. He al­so moved Dill out of a larg­er project (in the spir­it of Matthew's light­ning talk), and over to  <a href="https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill">GitHub</a>. Now all they need is a lo­go (Paul Ivanov sug­gest­ed a vari­a­tion on "we can pick­le that!").  </p><p>In al­l, it was a fun con­fer­ence. The best part, as al­ways, was meet­ing peo­ple in per­son, and talk­ing to them. To con­clude, I want to men­tion two oth­er in­ter­est­ing things that hap­pened.</p><p>The first is that Matthew and I talked se­ri­ous­ly about how to go about fix­ing the as­sump­tions in SymPy. I will write to the list about this soon, but the ba­sic idea is to just get in there and hack things to­geth­er, so that we can get some­thing that work­s. The work there is start­ed at http­s://github.­com/sympy/sympy/pul­l/2210, where I am see­ing if we can merge the old and new as­sump­tion­s, so that some­thing as­sumed in one can be asked in the old one.</p>The sec­ond thing is that On­drej got a new hat:  <a href="../../../../../2013/07/2013-06-26-08-02-40-hdr.jpg"><img src="../../../../../2013/07/2013-06-26-08-02-40-hdr.jpg" alt="Ondrej's Hat" width="450" height="602" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1344"></a></div>
