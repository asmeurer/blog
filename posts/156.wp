<html><body><p>So the next thing on my <a href="http://wiki.sympy.org/wiki/User:Asmeurer/GSoC2009_Application#Description_.28by_timeline.29">list</a> is seperable differential equations.  As I predicted in my proposal, I am going to have to do some work to get SymPy to recognize all equations that are separable.  Currently, it can match expressions that are exactly written as $a(x)b(y)\frac{dy}{dx}+c(x)d(y)=0$, such as $x^2(y+2)\frac{dy}{dx}-y^3=0$ but the matching engine cannot get things like $(x^2y+x^2)\frac{dy}{dx}+-y^3=0$, because it doesn't know how to factor out the $x^2$.  There is a function, collect, that can factor out expressions if you give them to it explicily (e.g., <code>collect(x**2*y+x**2,x**2)</code>), but it doesn't know yet how to separate variables in general.  So I will be working on it this week.  Once it can properly separate separable expressions, implementing it in dsolve will be cake.  


Also, it needs to learn how to do $latex\exp{x+y}\rightarrow\exp{x}\exp{y}$ and $1+x+y+xy \rightarrow (1+x)(1+y)$.  </p></body></html>
