<p>Read­ers of this blog know that I some­times like to write about some  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/modifying-a-list-while-looping-through-it-in-python/">strange</a>,  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/strange-python-behavior-can-someone-please-explain-to-me-what-is-going-on-here/">un­ex­pect­ed</a>, and  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/true-is-true-is-false-is-true-is-false/">un­usu­al</a>  things in Python that I stum­ble across.  This post is an­oth­er one of those.</p> 
 <p>First, look at this</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<span class="p">[[</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>What am I do­ing here?  I'm cre­at­ing a list,  <code>a</code>, and I'm adding it to it­self.  What you end up with is an in­fin­ite­ly nest­ed list.  The first in­ter­est­ing thing about this is that Python is smart enough to not ex­plode when print­ing this list.  The fol­low­ing should con­vince you that  <code>a</code>  does in­deed con­tain it­self.</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<span class="bp">True</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, if you have pro­grammed in C, or a sim­i­lar lan­guage that us­es point­er­s, this should not come as a sur­prise to you.  Lists in Python, like most things, do not ac­tu­al­ly con­tain the items in­side them.  Rather, they con­tain ref­er­ences (in C ter­mi­nol­o­gy, "point­er­s") to the items in­side them.  From this per­spec­tive, there is no is­sue at all with  <code>a</code>  con­tain­ing a point­er to it­self.</p> 
 <p>The first thing I won­dered when I saw this was just how clever the print­er was at notic­ing that the list was in­fin­ite­ly nest­ed.  What if we make the cy­cle a lit­tle more com­plex?</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<span class="p">[[[</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">]]]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>

<span class="p">[[[</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">]]]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">b</span>

<span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<span class="bp">True</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So it still work­s.  I had thought that maybe repr just catch­es  <code>Run­timeEr­ror</code>  and falls back to print­ing  <code>...</code>  when the list is nest­ed too deeply, but it turns out that is not true:</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10000</span><span class="p">):</span>

<span class="o">...</span>     <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="o">...</span> 

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<span class="n">Traceback</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">most</span> <span class="n">recent</span> <span class="n">call</span> <span class="n">last</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">File</span> <span class="s">"&lt;stdinreplaceme line in runtimeerror: maximum recursion depth exceeded while getting the repr of a list and by way case you were wondering it is possible to catch&gt;RuntimeError (using the same &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as the previous code block)</span>



<span class="sb">``</span><span class="err">`</span><span class="n">py</span>


<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>

<span class="o">...</span>     <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="o">...</span> <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">RuntimeError</span><span class="p">:</span>

<span class="o">...</span>     <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"no way"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="o">...</span> 

<span class="n">no</span> <span class="n">way</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(and you al­so may no­tice that this is Python 3. Things be­have the same way in Python 2)</p> 
 <p>Back to in­fin­ite­ly nest­ed list­s, we saw that print­ing work­s, but there are some things that don't work.</p> 
 <p>```py</p> 
 <blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a[0] == b</p> 
 </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>True</p> 
 <blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a[0] == a</p> 
 </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Trace­back (most re­cent call last):
  File "<stdinreplaceme line in runtimeerror: maximum recursion depth exceeded comparison>a[0] is b holds (i.e., they are ex­act­ly the same ob­ject in mem­o­ry), so  <code>==</code>  is able to short­-­cir­cuit on them.  But to test  <code>a[0] == a</code>  it has to re­cur­sive­ly com­pare the el­e­ments of  <code>a</code>  and  <code>a[0]</code>.  Since it is in­fin­ite­ly nest­ed, this leads to a re­cur­sion er­ror.  Now an in­ter­est­ing ques­tion: why does this hap­pen?  Is it be­cause  <code>==</code>  on lists us­es a depth first search?  If it were some­how pos­si­ble to com­pare these two ob­ject­s, would they be equal?</stdinreplaceme></p> 
 <p>One is re­mind­ed of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russel%27s_paradox">Rus­sel's para­dox</a>, and the rea­son why in  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">ax­iomat­ic set the­o­ry</a>, sets are not al­lowed to con­tain them­selves.  </p> 
 <p>Think­ing of this brought me to my fi­nal ques­tion.  Is it pos­si­ble to make a Python  <code>set</code>  that con­tains it­self?  The an­swer is ob­vi­ous­ly no, be­cause  <code>set</code>  ob­jects can on­ly con­tain hash­able ob­ject­s, and  <code>set</code>  is not hash­able.  But  <code>frozenset</code>,  <code>set</code>'s coun­ter­part, is hash­able.  So can you cre­ate a  <code>frozenset</code>  that con­tains it­self?  The same for  <code>tu­ple</code>.  The method I used for  <code>a</code>  above won't work, be­cause  <code>a</code>  must be mu­ta­ble to ap­pend it to it­self.</p>

<p>As  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/sympy-live-sphinx-extension/">promised</a>, here is an­oth­er post de­scrib­ing a new fea­ture in the up­com­ing  <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes-for-0.7.2">SymPy 0.7.2</a>.</p> 
 <p></p>
<h3>Automatic Symbol Definition</h3>
<p>While not as ground break­ing as the fea­ture I de­scribed in my  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/sympy-live-sphinx-extension/">last post</a>, this fea­ture is still quite use­ful. As you may know, SymPy is in­her­ent­ly a Python li­brary, mean­ing that it lives by the rules of Python. If you want to use any name, whether it be a Sym­bol or a func­tion (like cos), you need to de­fine it (in the case of Sym­bol­s), or im­port it (in the case of func­tions that come with SymPy). We pro­vide the script  <code>isympy</code>  with SymPy to as­sist with this. This script au­to­mat­i­cal­ly runs IPython (if it's in­stalled), im­ports all names from sympy (<code>from sympy im­port *</code>), and de­fines com­mon sym­bol names (like  <code>x</code>,  <code>y</code>, and  <code>z</code>).</p> 
 <p>But if you want to use a Sym­bol that is not one of the ones pre­de­fined by  <code>isympy</code>, you will get some­thing like</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>

<span class="o">---------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>

<span class="ne">NameError</span>                                 <span class="n">Traceback</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">most</span> <span class="n">recent</span> <span class="n">call</span> <span class="n">last</span><span class="p">)</span>
 <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">()</span>
<span class="o">----&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>



<span class="ne">NameError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="s">'r'</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">defined</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The best so­lu­tion for this has been ei­ther to type  <code>var('r')</code>, which will cre­ate the Sym­bol  <code>r</code>  and in­ject it in­to the names­pace, or to wrap your text in a string and pass it to  <code>sympi­fy()</code>, like  <code>sympi­fy("r*x")</code>. Nei­ther of these are very friend­ly in in­ter­ac­tive mod­e.</p> 
 <p>In SymPy 0.7.2,  <code>isympy</code>  has a new com­mand line op­tion,  <code>isympy -a</code>, which will en­able a mech­a­nism that will au­to­mat­i­cal­ly de­fine all un­de­fined names as Sym­bols for you:</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span>

<span class="n">Out</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="err">⋅</span><span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There are some caveats to be aware of when us­ing this fea­ture:</p> 
 <ul>
    <li>Names must be un­de­fined for  <code>isympy -a</code>  to work. If you type some­thing like  <code>S*x</code>, you'll get:```py

In [3]: S*x

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

­Type­Er­ror                                 Trace­back (most re­cent call last)

 <ipython-input-3-6656a97ea7b0replaceme in s typeerror: unsupported operand type for and that because>S is al­ready de­fined (it's the  <code>Sin­gle­ton­Reg­istry</code>, and al­so a short­cut to  <code>sympi­fy()</code>). To use a name that's al­ready de­fined, ei­ther cre­ate it man­u­al­ly with  <code>var()</code>  or delete it us­ing  <code>del</code>.</ipython-input-3-6656a97ea7b0replaceme>
</li> 
     <li>This on­ly works on the top lev­el names­pace. If you de­fine a func­tion with an un­de­fined name, it will not au­to­mat­i­cal­ly de­fine that sym­bol when run.</li> 
     <li>This works by catch­ing NameEr­ror, defin­ing the name, and then re-run­ning the ex­pres­sion. If you have a mul­ti­line state­men­t, any lines be­fore the un­de­fined name will be run be­fore the NameEr­ror will be caugh­t. This usu­al­ly won't hap­pen, but it's a po­ten­tial side-­ef­fect to be aware of. We plan to re­write it us­ing ei­ther ast or to­k­enize to avoid this is­sue.</li> 
     <li>Ob­vi­ous­ly, this is in­tend­ed for in­ter­ac­tive use on­ly. If you copy code and put it in a scrip­t, or in some oth­er place where some­one might be ex­pect­ed to run it, but not nec­es­sar­i­ly from  <code>isympy -a</code>, you should in­clude sym­bol def­i­ni­tion­s.</li> 
 </ul>

<h3>Automatic int to Integer Conversion</h3>

<p>A sec­ond thing that is an­noy­ing with Python and SymPy is that some­thing like  <code>1/2</code>  will be in­ter­pret­ed com­plete­ly by Python, with­out any SymPy. This means that some­thing like  <code>1/2 + x</code>  will give ei­ther  <code>0 + x</code>  or  <code>0.5 + x</code>, de­pend­ing on whether or not  <code><strong>fu­ture</strong>.di­vi­sion</code>  has been im­port­ed.  <code>isympy</code>  has al­ways ran  <code>from  <strong>fu­ture</strong>  im­port di­vi­sion</code>, so that you'll get the lat­ter, but we usu­al­ly would pre­fer to get  <code>Ra­tio­nal(1, 2)</code>. Pre­vi­ous­ly, the best way to do this was again to ei­ther run it through  <code>sympi­fy()</code>  as a string, or to sympi­fy at least one of the num­bers (here the  <code>S()</code>  short­cut to  <code>sympi­fy()</code>  is use­ful, be­cause you can type just  <code>S(1)/2</code>).</p> 
 <p>With SymPy 0.7.2, you can run  <code>isympy -i</code>, and it will au­to­mat­i­cal­ly wrap all in­te­gers lit­er­als with  <code>In­te­ger()</code>. The re­sult is that  <code>1/2</code>  pro­duces  <code>Ra­tio­nal(1, 2)</code>:</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">x</span>

<span class="n">Out</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Again, there are a cou­ple of caveat­s:</p> 
 <ul>
    <li>If you want to get Python style di­vi­sion, you just need to wrap both ar­gu­ments in  <code>in­t()</code>:```py

In [2]: in­t(1)/in­t(2)

Out[2]: 0.5



wzx­hzd­k:3




Note that to even do that ex­am­ple, I had to man­u­al­ly make  <code>a</code>  and  <code>b</code>  Python ints by wrap­ping them in  <code>in­t()</code>. If I had just done  <code>a = 1</code>, it would have been parsed as  <code>a = In­te­ger(1)</code>, and I would have got­ten a SymPy In­te­ger. But this can be an is­sue if you use the re­sult of some func­tion that re­turns an int (a­gain, note that most func­tions in SymPy that re­turn in­te­gers re­turn In­te­ger, not in­t).</li> 
     <li>The same as be­fore: this will on­ly work in­ter­ac­tive­ly. If you want to re­use your code out­side of  <code>isympy -i</code>, you should take care of any in­t/int by rewrit­ing it as S(in­t)/in­t.</li> 
 </ul>

<p>Since these are both use­ful fea­tures, we've added a way that you can get them both at on­ce: by do­ing  <code>isympy -I</code>  (the "I" stands for "In­ter­ac­tive"). If we add sim­i­lar fea­tures in the fu­ture, we will al­so add them to the  <code>-I</code>  short­cut (for ex­am­ple, we may add an op­tion to al­low  <code>^</code>  to au­to­mat­i­cal­ly be re­placed with  <code>**</code>).</p>

<p>I did­n't blog about SymPy all sum­mer, so I thought I would write a post about my fa­vorite fea­ture of the up­com­ing SymPy 0.7.2 re­lease.  In fac­t, this fea­ture has got me more ex­cit­ed than any oth­er fea­ture from any ver­sion of SymPy.  Yeah, it's that good.</p> 
 <p>The fea­ture is the SymPy Live Sphinx ex­ten­sion.  To start, if you don't know about it, check out  <a href="http://live.sympy.org/" target="_blank">SymPy Live</a>.  This is a con­sole that runs on the  <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">App En­gine</a>.  We've ac­tu­al­ly had this for quite some time, but this win­ter, it got a huge up­grade thanks to the con­tri­bu­tion of some  <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gci/homepage/google/gci2011">GCI</a>  stu­dents.  Ba­si­cal­ly, SymPy Live lets you try out SymPy in your brows­er com­plete­ly for free, be­cause it runs all the code on the App En­gine.  Ac­tu­al­ly, the con­sole is a full Python con­sole, so you can ac­tu­al­ly run any valid Python com­mand on it.  This past win­ter, GCI stu­dents up­grad­ed the look of the site, added a mo­bile ver­sion (vis­it live.sympy.org on your phone), and added oth­er neat fea­tures like search his­to­ry and au­to­com­ple­tion.</p> 
 <p>Now,  <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a>  is the doc­u­men­ta­tion sys­tem that we use to gen­er­ate  <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/">SymPy's html doc­u­men­ta­tion</a>. Last year, when I was at the  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/the-scipy-2011-conference/">SciPy Con­fer­ence</a>, Ma­teusz had an idea at the sprints to cre­ate an ex­ten­sion link­ing SymPy Live and Sphinx, so that the ex­am­ples in Sphinx could be eas­i­ly run in SymPy Live.  He did­n't fin­ish the ex­ten­sion, but I'm hap­py to re­port that thanks to David Li, who was al­so one of the afore­men­tioned G­CI stu­dents, the ex­ten­sion is now com­plete, and is run­ning live on our  <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/dev/">de­vel­op­ment docs</a>.  When SymPy 0.7.2 is re­leased (soon I promise), it will be part of the ofi­cial doc­u­men­ta­tion.</p> 
 <p>The best way to see how awe­some this is is to vis­it the web­site and check it out.  Y­ou will need a mod­ern brows­er (the lat­est ver­sion of Fire­fox, Sa­far­i, or Chrome will work, IE might work too).  Go to a page in the de­vel­op­ment docs with doc­u­men­ta­tion ex­am­ples, for ex­am­ple,  <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/dev/tutorial.html#algebra">http://­doc­s.sympy.org/de­v/­tu­to­ri­al.htm­l#al­ge­bra</a>, and click on one of the ex­am­ples (or click on one of the green "Run code block in SymPy Live" but­ton­s). You should see a con­sole pop up from the bot­tom-right of the screen, and run your code.  For ex­am­ple:</p> 
 <p><a href="2012/08/sympy-live-sphinx.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1149" title="SymPy-Live-Sphinx" src="2012/08/sympy-live-sphinx.png" alt="" width="450" height="317"></a>  Ex­am­ple of the SymPy Live Sphinx ex­ten­sion at  <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/dev/tutorial.html#algebra">http://­doc­s.sympy.org/de­v/­tu­to­ri­al.htm­l#al­ge­bra</a>. Click for larg­er im­age.</p> 
 <p>You can ac­cess or hide the con­sole at any time by click­ing on the green box at the bot­tom-right of the page.  If you click on "Set­tings", you will see that you can change all the same set­tings as the reg­u­lar SymPy Live con­sole, such as the print­er type, and the keys for ex­e­cu­tion and au­to­com­ple­tion.  Ad­di­tion­al­ly, there is a new set­ting, "E­val­u­a­tion Mod­e", which changes how the Sphinx ex­am­ples are eval­u­at­ed.  The de­fault is "E­val­u­ate".  In this mod­e, if you click on an ex­am­ple, it is ex­e­cut­ed im­me­di­ate­ly.  The oth­er op­tion is "Copy­".  In this mod­e, if you click an ex­am­ple, it is copied to the con­sole, but not ex­e­cut­ed right away. This way, you can ed­it the code to try some­thing dif­fer­en­t.  Re­mem­ber, this is a full fledged Python con­sole run­ning SymPy, so you can try lit­er­al­ly any­thing</p> 
 <p>So play with this and  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sympy">let us know</a>  what you think.  We would love to hear ways that we can im­prove the ex­pe­ri­ence even fur­ther.  In par­tic­u­lar, I think we should think about ways to make the "Copy" mode more user-friend­ly.  Sug­ges­tions wel­come!  Al­so, please  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues">re­port any bugs</a>.</p> 
 <p>And one word of warn­ing:  even though these are the de­vel­op­ment doc­s, SymPy Live is still run­ning SymPy 0.7.1.  So some ex­am­ples may not work un­til 0.7.2 is re­leased, at which point we will up­date SymPy Live.</p> 
 <p>I be­lieve that this ex­ten­sion rep­re­sents the fu­ture of in­ter­ac­tive doc­u­men­ta­tion. I hope you en­joy.</p>

<p>In my  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3/">fi­nal post</a>  about my switch­ing to Emac­s, a  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3/#comment-544">com­menter</a>, Scot­t, asked me, "It has been a while since you start­ed us­ing Emac­s. I’m just cu­ri­ous. How is your ex­pe­ri­ence so far now that you have more ex­pe­ri­ence and a more com­plete con­fig­u­ra­tion?"  My re­ply was get­ting quite long, so I fig­ured it would be best suit­ed as a new post.</p> 
 <p>The short an­swer is, most­ly the same since I wrote that  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3">Vim vs. Emacs (part 3)</a>. Once you use some­thing a lot, you no­tice all kinds of things that could use im­prove­ments. Some of them are just mi­nor an­noy­ances. For ex­am­ple, many in­ter­ac­tive com­mands in Emacs (but not al­l!) re­quire you to type out "yes" in­stead of just "y" as a con­fir­ma­tion. Oth­ers are more se­ri­ous, like the need for a re­al re­place­ment of Su­perTab from vim.</p> 
 <p>I ac­tu­al­ly did­n't have much free time to work on con­fig­ur­ing Emacs dur­ing the school year, and once the sum­mer start­ed, my com­put­er died, and I've been work­ing of an old lap­top run­ning Lin­ux un­til I can get a new one. For­tu­nate­ly, I had the fore­sight to put all my Emacs con­fig­u­ra­tion  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/dotfiles">on­line on GitHub</a>, so it was easy to get my con­fig­u­ra­tion again. I've no­ticed that in Lin­ux, the Alt key (i.e., Meta) is used for oth­er things, so it does­n't work so well in Emacs (e.g., press­ing Alt with­out any oth­er keys some­times ac­ti­vates a menu that re­moves the key­board fo­cus, and al­so C-M short­cuts don't seem to work at al­l).</p> 
 <p>I've mem­o­rized very few key­board short­cut­s, even ones that might be use­ful to me (e.g., I don't re­mem­ber the short­cut to jump to a match­ing paren­the­sis). Usu­al­ly, if I am us­ing some mode or some­thing and I want to know how to do some­thing, I just Google it, and gen­er­al­ly find the an­swer with­in a few sec­ond­s.</p> 
 <p>There are sev­er­al ma­jor con­fig­u­ra­tion is­sues that I've yet to ad­dress, ei­ther due to lack of time or be­cause I could­n't find a suit­able so­lu­tion. A Su­perTab re­place­ment is one.  This is ac­tu­al­ly a big one, be­cause scrolling through a file just to see what's there is get­ting old­er and old­er, as is search­ing just to jump to a func­tion def­i­ni­tion.  If any­one knows of a good way to do this, please let me know.  I main­ly need it for Python files, but hav­ing it oth­er modes as well would be nice.  Ba­si­cal­ly, I just want some­thing that shows me all the class and func­tion def­i­ni­tions in the file, in or­der, that I can eas­i­ly se­lect one and jump to it.</p> 
 <p>Re­lat­ed to search­ing, search­ing in Emacs suck­s. I'm us­ing isearch+, which is an im­prove­men­t, but it still bugs me that search does not wrap around by de­fault. Al­so, for some rea­son, press­ing delete does­n't delete the last char­ac­ter you type­d, but the last char­ac­ter that it matched. That may sound mi­nor, but I use it a lot, so it's re­al­ly got­ten on my nerves.</p> 
 <p>Reg­u­lar ex­pres­sion search­ing in Emacs is use­less.  I can nev­er get it to work (usu­al­ly be­cause of dif­fer­ences be­tween () and ()).  What I re­al­ly want is an in­ter­ac­tive, us­er friend­ly, reg­u­lar ex­pres­sion search/search and re­place tool.  There's reg­ex­p-builder, but that's use­less be­cause once you build the reg­u­lar ex­pres­sion, you have to man­u­al­ly copy it and paste it in­to the re­al reg­u­lar ex­pres­sion search func­tion to ac­tu­al­ly use it.  And it does­n't work with search and re­place.</p> 
 <p>This last se­mes­ter I had a se­mes­ter long project in C.  For that, fly­make-­mode was a god­send.  It re­quires a bit of man­u­al con­fig­u­ra­tion (y­ou have to add some­thing to your Make­file, and you have to add some stuff to .emacs as al­ways to en­able it by de­fault­), but once you do that, it just work­s.  If you don't know what this is, ba­si­cal­ly, it high­lights the com­pil­er er­rors in your source in re­al time, as you type it.  So in­stead of do­ing some­thing stupid twen­ty times, and then com­pil­ing and find­ing them al­l, you do some­thing stupid on­ce, see the er­ror, and don't do make the mis­take any more.  It's al­so nice to close your ed­i­tor and know that your code will com­pile.</p> 
 <p>The Python mode I am mixed about.  On the one hand, it's re­al­ly awe­some how smart it is about in­den­ta­tion.  On the oth­er hand, the syn­tax high­light­ing is just shy of what I want (grant­ed, it's pret­ty good, but I want bet­ter than that).  For ex­am­ple, I want to be able to col­or doc­strings, sin­gle quot­ed strings, and dou­ble quot­ed strings dif­fer­ent­ly.  It would al­so be awe­some to get some col­or­ing in doc­strings it­self.  I'm think­ing mark­down mode for any text that's in a doc­string, ex­cept for doctest­s, which are col­ored in Python mode (or some vari­ant).</p> 
 <p>Some things I've not re­al­ly cared much about yet be­cause I haven't used that type of file yet.  For ex­am­ple, I'm cur­rent­ly writ­ing this post in Emac­s, and just now notic­ing the de­fi­cien­cies in htm­l-­mode (e.g., I want an easy way to se­lect text and turn it in­to a link, just like in the Word­Press ed­i­tor).</p> 
 <p>Fi­nal­ly, I've been try­ing to write my own theme.  That process has been slow and slight­ly painful.  Emacs is cur­rent­ly in the process of mov­ing to themes, though, so this is to be ex­pect­ed.  When Emacs 24 is ac­tu­al­ly re­leased I think it will be fair to judge how well this fea­ture work­s.</p> 
 <p>That's my wish­list (or most of it any­way).  But there are pos­i­tive things too. au­to-­com­plete-­mod­e, which I men­tioned at the top of my pre­vi­ous blog post, is ab­so­lute­ly awe­some.  I think this ex­ten­sion alone has made me more pro­duc­tive.</p> 
 <p>Some things I take for grant­ed, like au­to­mat­ic spell check­ing of strings and com­ments in Python (not en­abled by de­fault, but not hard to con­fig­ure ei­ther).  Thanks to some­one on an Emacs mail­ing list, I have the per­fect au­to­mat­ic clear­ing of trail­ing whites­pace, that au­to­mat­i­cal­ly leaves your white­space be­fore the cur­sor in the buffer, but still writes the clear to the file (see my .emacs file from my dot­files re­po linked to above for de­tail­s).</p> 
 <p>I've been hop­ing to learn Emacs lisp, so that I could rem­e­dy many of these prob­lems on my own, but so far I haven't re­al­ly had the free time.  Lisp is a very con­fus­ing lan­guage, so it's not easy to jump in­to (com­pared to the lan­guage vim us­es, which I found easy enough to hack on with­out know­ing at al­l).</p> 
 <p>Ul­ti­mate­ly, I'm quite pleased with how us­er friend­ly Emacs is, and with how easy it is to find out how to do al­most any­thing I want just by Googling it. Con­fig­u­ra­tion is an up­hill bat­tle.  Emacs has a ton of great pack­ages, many of which are in­clud­ed, but al­most none are en­abled by de­fault.  Just to­day I dis­cov­ered Ido mod­e, thanks to  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/vim-vs-emacs-part-3/#comment-543">  David Li</a>.  I feel that in the long ter­m, as I learn Emacs Lisp, I can make it do what­ev­er I wan­t.  It pro­vides a good base­line edit­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, and a good frame­work for con­fig­ur­ing it to do what­ev­er you wan­t, and al­so enough peo­ple use it that 99% of the things you want are al­ready done by some­body.</p>

<p>Both the awe­some  <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html">IPython note­book</a>  and  <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/qtconsole.html">Qt­con­sole</a>  are in the Ubun­tu repos­i­to­ries, so if you just want to use the sta­ble re­leased ver­sion­s, you can just do</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre>sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook ipython-qtconsole
</pre></div>


<p>and be on your way.  But the git de­vel­op­ment ver­sion has a lot of cool new fea­tures, and you may not want to wait for 0.13 to be re­leased and make its way to the Ubun­tu re­pos.  But you may be think­ing that to use those you will have to fig­ure out all the de­pen­den­cies your­self.  Ac­tu­al­ly, it's pret­ty easy:</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c"># First install git, if you don't already have it</span>

sudo apt-get install git

<span class="c"># Then, clone the IPython repo, if you haven't already.</span>

git clone git://github.com/ipython/ipython.git

<span class="nb">cd </span>ipython

<span class="c"># Now just install IPython with apt, then uninstall it.  The dependencies will remain</span>

sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook ipython-qtconsole

sudo apt-get remove ipython-notebook ipython -qtconsole ipython

<span class="c"># Now install the IPython git version in such a way that will keep up to date when you pull</span>

sudo python setup.py develop
</pre></div>


<p>To up­date, just cd in­to that ipython di­rec­to­ry and type  <code>git pull</code>.  That's it.  Now type  <code>ipython note­book</code>  or  <code>ipython qt­con­sole</code>  to get the mag­ic.</p> 
 <p>ED­IT: Af­ter you do this,  <code>ap­t-get</code>  will start bug­ging you ev­ery time that you use it that a bunch of pack­ages are no longer need­ed.  These are the ones that you do need for the qt­con­sole and the note­book, so you should not au­tore­move them as it says.  Rather, set them as man­u­al­ly in­stalled by copy­ing the list of pack­ages that it tells you about and  <code>su­do ap­t-get in­stall</code>ing them.</p>

<p>See parts  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/vim-vs-emacs-part-1/">1</a>  and  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/vim-vs-emacs-part-2/">2</a>.</p> 
 <p>Some more com­ments af­ter us­ing emacs for a while:</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;</span>I finally found the perfect tab completion solution. It took way too much searching for how awesome it is.  It's called <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/manual.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>auto-complete-mode<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>.  The best way to get an idea of what this is is to watch <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGVVnDxwJYE"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>this screencast<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>.  Basically, it shows you a completion list automatically.  It uses the <span class="nt">&lt;em&gt;</span>TAB<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;</span> key to do completion (to me, this is a no brainer, but for some reason, no other completion extension that I found did this, requiring you to do all kinds of nonsense in your .emacs file).  It's got cool features like simple fuzzy matching and intelligent matching (so the first completion is what you tend to use, instead of just the first one that matches).  To quote the author, "a goal of auto-complete-mode is to provide a system that does what users want without any command." I couldn't agree with that goal more. If you install it, I recommend adding <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>(define-key ac-mode-map (kbd "M-TAB") 'auto-complete)<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> to your .emacs, so that you can use M-TAB to force the completion menu to come up.  This generally happens automatically, but I think this is the only way to get fuzzy matching, for example. Actually, you can also just use <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>(ac-set-trigger-key "TAB")<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, which intelligently sets TAB to complete or indent, based on which one you more likely want.  This seems to work pretty well to me.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Speaking of indenting, emacs has a pretty nice indentation feature for Python.  You just press <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>TAB<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> repeatedly, and it cycles through all the syntactically legal indentations.  I find this to be more useful than the usual <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>TAB<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> indents behavior of most editors. Note that by default, it won't automatically indent, even with trivial indentations (i.e., keeping the previous indentation).  This is easy to fix, though.  Just add <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>(define-key global-map (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent)<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> to your .emacs file.  This will make <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>RET<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> do the same thing as <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-j<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, i.e., basically the equivalent of <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>RET TAB<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>emacs comes with an extension that lets you work with version control systems, called VC.  I don't use it.  I don't like stuff messing with my git stuff behind my back (sounds like a good way to lose data to me), and I'm good enough with git commands straight that I don't need the help.
</pre></div>


<p>But un­like all the oth­er hun­dreds of emacs fea­tures that I don't use, this one was se­ri­ous­ly slow­ing down my work­flow.  It adds three or four sec­onds to the start­up time of emacs when load­ing from with­in a git repos­i­to­ry.  So I did some Googling and added this to my .emacs file:</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">;;</span> <span class="n">Disable</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">version</span> <span class="n">control</span> <span class="n">stuff</span>         

<span class="p">;;</span> <span class="n">Makes</span> <span class="n">emacs</span> <span class="n">load</span> <span class="n">much</span> <span class="n">faster</span> <span class="n">inside</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">repos</span> 



<span class="p">(</span><span class="n">setq</span> <span class="n">vc</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">handled</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">backends</span> <span class="n">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(<em>un­re­lat­ed: Why does­n't Word­Press sup­port lisp as a lan­guage for syn­tax high­light­ing?</em>)</p> 
 <p>This dis­ables the ver­sion con­trol stuff, mak­ing emacs load fast again (vir­tu­al­ly as fast as vim, ac­tu­al­ly).</p> 


 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Speaking of making emacs go faster, make sure you compile all your extensions into byte code.  For whatever reason, emacs doesn't do this automatically, even though compiled files run much faster, and it doesn't take very long.  The easiest way is to use <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-x byte-compile-file<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> from within emacs.  Just make sure that if you modify the .el file that you recompile the byte code, or it will continue to use the old version.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>



<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I finally figured out how to enable mouse support.  For whatever reason, Googling got me nowhere with this, so I ended up asking on the <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>help-gnu-emacs<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> list, which was very helpful.  The solution is to put
</pre></div>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">;;</span> <span class="o">=====</span> <span class="n">Enable</span> <span class="n">mouse</span> <span class="n">support</span> <span class="o">====</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="n">require</span> <span class="err">'</span><span class="n">xt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">mouse</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>


<p>in your .emacs file.  And then it just work­s.  It needs some tweak­ing (e.g., it does­n't play so well with mo­men­tum scrolling), but at least it work­s. I thought I was go­ing to hang my­self with­out mouse sup­port. Be­cause frankly, as good as the move­ment com­mands are, mov­ing with the mouse is so much eas­i­er some­times (the same is true for vim too, btw).</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I compiled the git version of emacs (it's not very hard btw).  I did this to see if the mouse suport "bug" was fixed there, but I've gone ahead and kept using it, as it's nicer.  But I didn't figure out how to configure it to not load in an X window. So for now, I've aliased <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>emacs<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> to <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>emacs -nw<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>. I'm sure I just need to add some flag to <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>configure<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, but I haven't gotten around to looking it up yet.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I found out how to allow editing in the Isearch mode (again, thanks to the help-gnu-emacs list).  You need to install the <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://github.com/asmeurer/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/lisp/isearch%2B.el"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>isearch+<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> extension, add the following to your .emacs,
</pre></div>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">;;</span> <span class="o">=====</span> <span class="n">isearch</span><span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">=====</span>         



<span class="p">(</span><span class="n">require</span> <span class="err">'</span><span class="n">isearch</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and most im­por­tant­ly, you need to ed­it the file and un­com­ment all the com­m­mands you want to al­low.  If you fol­low my link above, it goes to my per­son­al dot­files re­po, where I've al­ready done that.</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>On a related note, this is the first of several emacs extensions I've installed that I've edited the extension file itself for.  The rest, I just had to add some code to .emacs.  In most cases, there was already a variable or suggested code snippet to add to .emacs to get what I wanted.
</pre></div>


<p>On the oth­er hand, with vim, I had to ed­it vir­tu­al­ly ev­ery ex­ten­sion I in­stalled to make it do what I wan­t.  I'm not sure what this mean­s, though.  It could be a state­ment about one of many things: how the emacs com­mu­ni­ty pro­vides nicer de­fault­s, how the vim lan­guage is eas­i­er to use, and hence more invit­ing for me to ed­it the files, or how I haven't got­ten around to mess­ing with cer­tain things yet.</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you do a lot of work with LaTeX, check out <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>AUCTeX<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>. I haven't used it enough yet to say much about it, but from what I've played around with, it's pretty awesome.  And if you use a windowed version of emacs, it's got a really awesome preview mode.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you're bored, check out the <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.dr-qubit.org/predictive/predictive-user-manual/html/index.php"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>predictive<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> extension.  It's actually not as helpful as you'd think (unlike the very similar auto-complete-mode module mentioned above).  But it's kind of cool to turn on and play around with when you're typing something.  Maybe you'll learn new words or something.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I could go on and on.  I haven't mentioned the most basic customizations (like how to setup four-space tabs).  If you are starting to use emacs, I recommend going through <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-x customize<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, and reading my <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://github.com/asmeurer/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;code&gt;</span>.emacs<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span> file.  And my best advice: if you want emacs to do something, first do <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-x customize<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> and search for what you want (EDIT: apparently searching customize requires emacs 24, i.e., the development version).  If you don't find what you want there (and you will surprisingly often), search Google.  There are so many emacs users, that the chances of someone else wanting what you want are very likely. I've found the results from the <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.emacswiki.org/"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>emacs wiki<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> to be particularly helpful. And one more thing: if you find an extension you like, double check first to see if it's not already included in emacs. Emacs seems to like including good extensions in future releases, so an older extension has a good chance of already being included.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Some emacs ques­tion­s:</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>I tried <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>(define-abbrev global-abbrev-table "Ondrej" "Ondřej")<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, so that when I type Ondrej it give me Ondřej.  But it doesn't work.  Is this a bug or what? If I do <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>(define-abbrev global-abbrev-table "foo" "bar")<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> and type "foo", it turns into "bar", but the above leaves Ondrej alone. <span class="nt">&lt;em&gt;</span>EDIT: I guess this was an emacs bug.  It doesn't seem to be there any more (perhaps it was fixed with the git version or something).<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Is there a way to reload .emacs without closing emacs? I'm doing that a lot these days. <span class="nt">&lt;em&gt;</span>EDIT: I found it. Do <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-x load-file RET ~/.emacs<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Is there a good emacs equivalent of the vim <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>tag list plugin<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>  (thanks for commenter Scott for pointing me to that in the first place)?  I just want something that lists all the class and function definitions in a Python file in order, so I can easily jump to the one I want, or just get an overview of the file.  <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This Tues­day will mark the point where I will have spend as long us­ing emacs as I did us­ing vim. But al­ready, I feel more com­pe­tent with emac­s.  I won't re­peat what I said in my last post, but I just want to say that the abil­i­ty to ed­it and write at the same time makes me way more pro­duc­tive.  The fact that it us­es key­board short­cuts that I'm al­ready used to prob­a­bly helps a lot too.  Even so, I've not used any kind of cheat sheet for emacs (s­ince I nev­er re­al­ly found any that were any good), and yet I feel like I've mem­o­rized more key com­mands now than I ev­er did with vim, for which I did use a  <a href="http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html">cheat sheet</a>.   </p> 
 <p>So I re­al­ly don't see my­self go­ing back to vim at this point.</p> 
 <p>I'm ac­tu­al­ly sur­prised.  Vir­tu­al­ly ev­ery­one I know who us­es a com­mand line ed­i­tor us­es vim.  It's def­i­nite­ly the more pop­u­lar of the two.  But hav­ing tried both, I can on­ly spec­u­late as to why.  Vim has a much high­er learn­ing curve than emac­s.  Ev­ery­body grows up learn­ing how to write text in ed­i­tors like Mi­cro­soft Word, TextE­d­it, Notepad, etc., that all work fun­da­men­tal­ly like emac­s: if you type tex­t, it en­ters the tex­t.  If you want to do ad­vanced edit­ing with the key­board, you hold down some meta keys and type chord­ed key­board short­cut­s.  The vim modal edit­ing method­ol­o­gy is so dif­fer­ent from this, that it sur­pris­es me that so many peo­ple go to the trou­ble of learn­ing it (I mean, to the point that they are more ef­fi­cient with it).  I can see the ben­e­fit over GUI ed­i­tors, which have noth­ing on ei­ther vim or emacs with re­gards to cus­tomiza­tion, or just the plain edit­ing pow­er that is re­al­ly nec­es­sary for cod­ing. My guess­es why peo­ple use vim:</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>They are shown vim first, so just use it.
</pre></div>




<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>They are turned off by the massiveness of emacs (it seems contradictory to me, since the whole point of using a command line editor is to get more power, but I could see it).
</pre></div>




<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>They are turned off by emacs lisp.
</pre></div>




<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Some combination of those.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Maybe the vim users out there could com­ment why they use vim.  Am I miss­ing some­thing?  Or are your heads just wired dif­fer­ent­ly from mine? And if you use emacs (or any­thing else), I'd love to hear from you too?</p> 
 <p>At any rate, I rec­om­mend that any­one who wants to give com­mand line ed­i­tors a chance do what I did: learn both vim and emac­s.  My blog posts should be enough to give you some good ad­vice.  I went cold-­turkey, and I rec­om­mend that you do too, but on­ly do it if you won't have any im­por­tant edit­ing to do for a few week­s, as your edit­ing rate will slow down a lot as you are learn­ing for both ed­i­tors.  And even though I think I am go­ing to stick with emac­s, learn­ing vim was still valu­able.  Un­like emac­s, vi is part of the POSIX stan­dard, so it's in­clud­ed in pret­ty much ev­ery UNIX dis­tri­bu­tion.  I'll be glad when I find my­self on a min­i­mal com­mand line and know how to use a de­cent text ed­i­tor.  And any­way, you can't re­al­ly know which one will be your way un­til you try them both.  I re­al­ly thought I would end up us­ing vim, as it was so pop­u­lar among all the peo­ple I know who use com­mand line ed­i­tors. But I guess there is on­ly  <a href="http://www.dina.dk/~abraham/religion/">One True Ed­i­tor</a>.</p> 
 <p><strong>ED­IT:</strong>  I found out how to make emacs re­al­ly fast.  The key is to run one process of emacs in dae­mon mod­e, and have the rest con­nect to that.  Then you on­ly have to wait for the start­up once (per com­put­er ses­sion).  To do it, just set your  <code>ED­I­TOR</code>  to  <code>'emac­sclient -a "" -n­w'</code>  (and you might al­so want to alias  <code>emacs</code>  to that as well).  What this does is con­nect to the emacs dae­mon.  The  <code>-a ""</code>  starts one if it is­n't al­ready start­ed (y­ou can al­so do this your­self with  <code>emacs --­dae­mon</code>.  If you on­ly want to use the dae­mon ver­sion if you've specif­i­cal­ly start­ed it, re­place  <code>""</code>  with  <code>emacs</code>.  This will con­nect to the dae­mon if it's run­ning, and oth­er­wise just start a new emacs process.   </p> 
 <p>The  <code>-nw</code>  keeps it from run­ning in win­dow mod­e.  Re­move this if you use the GUI ver­sion of emac­s.  This is nec­es­sary to make it work cor­rect­ly with mul­ti­ple tab­s.  This is so fast that you should nev­er re­al­ly even need to use  <code>C-z</code>  to quick­ly ex­it emac­s.   <code>C-x C-c</code>  is just fine, be­cause re­open­ing will be in­stan­ta­neous.  I like this be­cause I was start­ing to ac­cu­mu­late back­ground emacs pro­cess­es that I for­got about.</p> 
 <p>This prob­a­bly re­quires a fair­ly new ver­sion of emac­s, pos­si­bly even the de­vel­op­ment ver­sion.</p>

<p>As I not­ed in  <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/vim-vs-emacs-part-1/">part 1</a>, I have de­cid­ed to switch to a com­mand line text ed­i­tor.  I de­cid­ed that, to be fair, I would try both vim and emac­s.  And to force my­self to learn them, I de­cid­ed to use them cold-­turkey.   </p> 
 <p>Since I'm go­ing cold-­turkey, I am do­ing this over my break from class­es, so that I can weed out any dif­fi­cul­ties dur­ing a pe­ri­od when I can live with slow text edit­ing if nec­es­sary.  This is a one month break.  I have reached (rough­ly) the half way point.  For the first half, I used noth­ing but vim to ed­it tex­t.  Now, I will use noth­ing but emac­s.</p> 
 <p>Now that I've stopped us­ing vim (for now any­way), my view of it is­n't much dif­fer­ent from what I wrote in the first part.  A lot of things there were ad­dressed by com­menters (or rather com­menter).  I still feel that it's not an a method of text edit­ing that fits my head.  My en­tire life, I've used text ed­i­tors where typ­ing in­serts tex­t, and var­i­ous con­trol char­ac­ters do things like move around faster.   </p> 
 <p>En­ter emac­s. It does ex­act­ly this.  Al­so a ton more.</p> 
 <p>I've on­ly been us­ing emacs for two days, but here are my im­pres­sions so far:</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>The tutorial is better.<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>  When you start emacs, it tells you how to start the tutorial.  Just type <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-h t<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> (if you don't already know, in emacs <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>C-<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> means <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>CTRL-<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> and <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> means <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>ALT-<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>).  Like I said last time, the very first thing you learn is how to scroll by more than one line at a time.  That turns out to be a very useful thing to do.  Also, the emacs tutorial did a better job of explaining how to use multiple files at once in emacs, which is something that I still don't really know how to do very well in vim.

<p>I have to give the vim tu­to­ri­al some cred­it for one thing, though.  It has bet­ter in­ter­ac­tive ex­am­ples.  For ex­am­ple, in the vim tu­to­ri­al, you have stuff like  </p>

<p>which is a lit­tle more vague.  So I have to give vim cred­it for that.   </p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>Everything's a buffer.<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> This line from the emacs tutorial really stuck with me: "ANY text you see in an Emacs window is always part of some buffer."  Emacs has really a awesome editing model, even simple things like <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-f<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> and <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-b<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> to move around words at a time, or <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-DEL<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> to delete whole words make things <span class="nt">&lt;strong&gt;</span>way<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> faster.  Vim of course has all of these too, albiet in a different way, but they aren't everywhere.  In emacs, everything is a buffer, which just means that everything supports all the standard emacs commands.  So if you type <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-x<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> (roughly the equivalent of vim's <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>:<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>) and start typing a command, you can move around and edit your command with emacs commands.  One of the things that bothered me about vim was that when I was typing something with <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>:<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, I couldn't use vim's text moving/modifying commands to manipulate the text.  Typing ESC just canceled the command.
</pre></div>


<p>Ex­cep­tion­s: There are at least two ex­cep­tions I've found to this rule.  First, if you do a search with  <code>C-s</code>  or  <code>C-r</code>, no con­trol com­mands work.  If you type a search string, and then type  <code>M-DEL</code>  to try to delete the last word in your search string, you will in­stead delete the word where the cur­sor is!  The so­lu­tion I think is to use some­thing like  <code>M-x re-builder</code>  in­stead.  This was a lit­tle slow in my test­s.</p> 
 <p>Sec­ond, the emacs man­u­al is pre­sent­ed in the  <code>in­fo</code>  pro­gram, which us­es com­plete­ly dif­fer­ent key com­mands from ev­ery oth­er pro­gram.  This irked me quite a bit, be­cause as soon as I fin­ished the emacs tu­to­ri­al, it point­ed me to the man­u­al, which was in  <code>in­fo</code>.  Then, the first thing in  <code>in­fo</code>  is a tu­to­ri­al on how to use  <code>in­fo</code>!  I opt­ed to skip this.  If I need any in­for­ma­tion on emac­s, I'll just do a Google search any­way, so I found this to be a waste of time.</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>It's a little slower.<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> I do notice a speed difference between emacs and vim.  vim is much more lightweight, and it shows.  Starting up emacs takes a second or two.  Also, since a lot of the features are more interactive, they suffer from a speed delay.  It's not nearly slow enough to be a serious issue, though, and it's still way faster than the GUI program I was using before (start up time).
</pre></div>


<p>The emacs tu­to­ri­al sug­gests us­ing  <code>C-z</code>  when­ev­er you want to on­ly tem­po­rar­ily close emac­s.  This seems like a good idea, and has worked pret­ty well for me so far (though I still usu­al­ly close the whole thing with  <code>C-x C-c</code>  out of habit).</p> 
 <p>On a re­lat­ed note, I no­ticed that do­ing type­-a­head while wait­ing for emacs to start up did­n't al­ways work, where­as it al­ways worked in vim (I do this, e.g., when wait­ing for the ed­i­tor to start up when writ­ing com­mit mes­sages).</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>It's way more user-friendly.<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Note that this is of course a relative term.  I mean more user-friendly than vim, and pretty user-friendly for a command line program.  Obviously, the most user-friendly text editors are the GUI ones used by the majority of the population (for that very reason).  Actually, both vim and emacs are user-unfriendly in that if you accidentally open them and don't know what they are or how to use them, you have no idea how to close them.  But even <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>less<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> (i.e., <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>man<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>) is technically like this.
</pre></div>


<p>I'm not even re­fer­ring to the dif­fer­ent edit­ing "mod­es" of the two ed­i­tors, though you could eas­i­ly ar­gue that emacs style edit­ing is more user-friend­ly than vim style edit­ing. What I mean here is that emacs in­ter­ac­tion is nice. When you type  <code>:</code>  in vim, start typ­ing a com­mand, and type  <code>TAB</code>, it en­ters the first com­ple­tion, re­gard­less if it's unique.  Press­ing  <code>TAB</code>  mul­ti­ple times give the rest.  In emac­s, if you type  <code>M-x</code>  and start typ­ing a com­mand and type  <code>TAB</code>, it pops up a tem­po­rary win­dow with the list of all com­ple­tion­s.  It even col­ors the next char­ac­ter, so you can eas­i­ly see what to type next to get what you wan­t.  As soon as you en­ter the com­mand, the win­dow dis­ap­pears. (yes, I know about  <code>CTR­L-D</code>  in vim, but to me tab com­ple­tion should  <em>al­ways</em>  work like it does in bash: com­plete char­ac­ters if and on­ly if they are unique in the list of com­ple­tion­s)</p> 
 <p>By the way, when I said ev­ery­thing's a buffer, I mean ev­ery­thing.  If you wan­t, you can ex­it the  <code>M-x</code>  en­try (type  <code>C-g</code>), type  <code>C-x C-b</code>  to show the list of buffer­s,  <code>C-x o</code>  to switch to it, scroll down to "Com­ple­tion­s", press En­ter, and ac­tu­al­ly get in the com­ple­tion list, as a buf­fer (there's prob­a­bly a less com­pli­cat­ed way to get to it, by the way).  You can then do what­ev­er your heart fan­cies with it (save it to a file, copy it, what­ev­er).</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>Customization is harder.<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> This was expected, since I already knew that emacs used lisp.  vim uses a language that is really easy to understand.  I was able to modify all the vim plugins I installed very easily.  If you want to change a setting globally in vim, just Google it and add one line to your .vimrc.   In emacs, everything is in Emacs Lisp.  I suppose prior experience with Lisp would probably help here.
</pre></div>


<p>In the vim tu­to­ri­al, near the end, it told how to cre­ate a .vim­rc file, and even gave a very use­ful sam­ple one as a starter.  In emac­s, it took me a while to fig­ure out how to do the equiv­a­lent (it took me a few Google search­es just to fig­ure out that the name of the con­fig­u­ra­tion file in emacs is .emac­s).   </p> 
 <p>Ac­tu­al­ly, the emacs equiv­a­lent is way bet­ter than in vim, but it is­n't re­al­ly men­tioned any­where. It took me prob­a­bly a dozen Google search­es be­fore I learned about it (grant­ed, I was look­ing for things in the same way I did for vim, lines to add to .emac­s). What you have to do is type  <code>M-x con­fig­ure</code>.  This opens what is ba­si­cal­ly a huge pref­er­ences di­a­log for emac­s.  You can then go through and set just about ev­ery set­table emacs set­ting from there.  The in­ter­face is very nice, as it's in­ter­ac­tive and tells you all about each set­ting.  And you nev­er have to touch Lisp.  I'm still go­ing through it, so I can't com­ment more on it yet.  But I rec­om­mend do­ing  <code>M-x con­fig­ure</code>  as soon as you have fin­ished the tu­to­ri­al and have got­ten used to edit­ing with emac­s, as you are in­vari­ably go­ing to want to change some things (though I should note that emacs gen­er­al­ly has nicer de­faults than vim).</p> 
 <div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>Better text editing methodology?<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Like I've already mentioned a bunch of times, the emacs editing model seems to fit my head better than the vim model.  In emacs, you type text, and it inserts the text.  If you want to do some advanced modification or move around, you type a control sequence.  In vim, you type characters, and it does modifications or moves around.  If you want to type text, you type <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>i<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> (or one of a few other characters) and type it.  Then, if you want to move around or modify the text, you have to press <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>ESC<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>.  This so-called "modular editing" doesn't seem to work for me.  For one thing, I like to rapidly switch back and forth between these two "modes" (editing and inserting) when I write things.  I type too fast and write something wrong, and have to delete some stuff. The <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>M-DEL<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> emacs command is probably my most used (this also works in Mac OS X text dialogs, so I'm used to it already).  In vim, there is <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>CTRL-w<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> and a few others, but if I want to do something more advanced, like rearranging a sentence, then half of my key presses would be <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>ESC<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span> or <span class="nt">&lt;code&gt;</span>i<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;</span>, i.e., just moving between the modes.  In emacs, I can always have my pinky by Control and Alt (especially as soon as I remap CAPS-LOCK to Control).
</pre></div>


<p>Al­so, it re­al­ly irks me how in vim, if you are at the end of a line and press  <code>l</code>  (or right-ar­row), in­stead of mov­ing to the be­gin­ning of the next line, it beep­s!  In emac­s, if you are at the end of a the line and type  <code>C-f</code>, it moves to the be­gin­ning of the next line (ac­tu­al­ly, it tech­ni­cal­ly moves just be­yond the line, in case you want to ap­pend, which is an­oth­er an­noy­ing thing about vim: you have to use  <code>A</code>, not  <code>i</code>,  to add text to the end of a line).  </p> 
 <p>Well, that's it for now.  I will hold off on the ques­tions un­til af­ter I go through all the cus­tomiza­tion­s, as it seems that, un­like vim, emacs has many things al­ready built-in (but we al­ready knew that, did­n't we :).  So I have just one ques­tion for read­er­s: does any­one know of a re­al­ly good emacs cheat­sheet?  The  <a href="http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html">one I used for vim</a>  was re­al­ly awe­some, but I haven't found any­thing equal for emac­s.  I find my­self search­ing the tu­to­ri­al when­ev­er I for­get some­thing, which is not very ef­fi­cien­t, so I would ap­pre­ci­ate some­thing bet­ter. Oth­er­wise, I'll just find some­thing de­cent and print it out, as it would be bet­ter than noth­ing.</p> 
 <p>And if any­one cares, you can see what I've got for my .emacs file so far at  <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs">http­s://github.­com/as­meur­er/­dot­files/blob/­mas­ter/.emacs</a>.</p>
