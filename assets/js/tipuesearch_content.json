      "text": "So I've fi\u00adnal\u00adly de\u00adcid\u00aded to move my blog from Word\u00adpress to GitHub pages.  I\nhigh\u00adly rec\u00adom\u00admend it if you are tech\u00adni\u00adcal\u00adly skilled enough to do it. I was\nget\u00adting pret\u00adty an\u00adnoyed at Word\u00adpress. It forces you to write your posts in\u00ad\nhtml (or else us\u00ading their WYSI\u00adWYG ed\u00adi\u00adtor), the word\u00adpress.\u00adcom is locked down,\n\u00adso you can't add any Javascrip\u00adt, their math is stuck in the past ren\u00adder\u00ading png\nin\u00adstead of us\u00ading Math\u00adJax. The list goes on. \n With GitHub pages, I can write my posts in Mark\u00addown, and I have full con\u00adtrol\nover ev\u00adery\u00adthing. And there is no lock in. If I de\u00adcide I don't like the\n\u00adsoft\u00adware that is gen\u00ader\u00adat\u00ading the post\u00ads, I can eas\u00adi\u00adly move to some\u00adthing else,\ns\u00adince the post con\u00adtent it\u00adself is all Mark\u00addown (or the oc\u00adca\u00adsion\u00adal rst or\nIPython note\u00adbook if I want to do some\u00adthing that Mark\u00addown does\u00adn't sup\u00adport\u00ad). \n Here's the guide on how to do it. First, you need to set up GitHub pages. This\nis a bit con\u00adfus\u00ading, be\u00adcause there are ac\u00adtu\u00adal\u00adly two kinds of GitHub pages, user\n\u00adpages and project pages. Us\u00ader pages are if you have a re\u00adpo named\n user\u00adname.github.io  (or  .com). The pages are served from the  mas\u00adter \nbranch. \n For project pages, you add a  gh-\u00adpages  branch to any one of your pro\u00adject\u00ads,\nand GitHub hosts the con\u00adtent au\u00adto\u00admat\u00adi\u00adcal\u00adly at\n user\u00adname.github.io/pro\u00adject\u00adname. I orig\u00adi\u00adnal\u00adly had my blog con\u00adtent at\n as\u00admeur\u00ader.github.io, but I did\u00adn't like that I had to do ev\u00adery\u00adthing in mas\u00adter,\nboth the gen\u00ader\u00adat\u00aded and orig\u00adi\u00adnal con\u00adtent. So in\u00adstead I cre\u00adat\u00aded a re\u00adpo called\n blog. I have my con\u00adtent in the  mas\u00adter  branch and the gen\u00ader\u00adat\u00aded pages in\u00ad\nthe  gh-\u00adpages  branch (more on this lat\u00ader). At my\n as\u00admeur\u00ader.github.\u00adcom  re\u00adpo,\nI just have for now a ba\u00adsic re\u00addi\u00adrect to the blog. In the fu\u00adture, I may want to\nput ad\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal, non-blog con\u00adtent on the web\u00adsite, and it would go there (or in\u00ad\na sep\u00ada\u00adrate project re\u00adpo with its own  gh-\u00adpages  branch). \n Nikola\nI had ini\u00adtial\u00adly planned on us\u00ading\n Pel\u00adi\u00adcan. How\u00adev\u00ader, I got stalled on the\n\u00adWord\u00adpress im\u00adport. I like that Pel\u00adi\u00adcan is writ\u00adten in Python, but I was not too\n\u00adkeen on their abra\u00adsive\n li\u00adcense. Frankly,\nI should\u00adn't say too many bad things about Pel\u00adi\u00adcan be\u00adcause I nev\u00ader re\u00adal\u00adly tried\nthat hard with it. \n I have de\u00adcid\u00aded to try  Niko\u00adla  in\u00adstead. It's al\u00adso\nwrit\u00adten in Python. It has a very nice\n li\u00adcense. I like\nthe phi\u00adlos\u00ado\u00adphy of the  man\u00adu\u00adal: \n \nDON'T READ THIS MAN\u00adU\u00adAL. IF YOU NEED TO READ IT I FAILED, JUST USE THE THING. \n \nI've al\u00adso dis\u00adcov\u00adered that the\n Niko\u00adla com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adty  is\n very  nice. And of course, even if Niko\u00adla ends up not be\u00ading for me, it will\nbe easy to switch, be\u00adcause my ac\u00adtu\u00adal con\u00adtent is just some Mark\u00addown files that\nI own. \n Getting started\nGet\u00adting start\u00aded with Niko\u00adla is pret\u00adty easy. First, you need to in\u00adstall it. It\nhas a  ton  of de\u00adpen\u00adden\u00adcies (for\u00adtu\u00adnate\u00adly all Python, so it won't be that\nhard). In ad\u00addi\u00adtion to the ones in the re\u00adquire\u00adments.tx\u00adt, you should al\u00adso\nin\u00adstall  mark\u00addown  and  we\u00adbas\u00adsets. While us\u00ading  niko\u00adla, it will tell you if\ny\u00adou don't have some\u00adthing in\u00adstalled that you should, so if you see that, just\nin\u00adstall what it tells you to.  If you use  con\u00adda  and Mac OS X, I have\nu\u00adpload\u00aded all the de\u00adpen\u00adden\u00adcies to my  Bin\u00adstar,\n\u00adso you can just  con\u00adda in\u00adstall -c as\u00admeur\u00ader niko\u00adla. \n Then you just run the com\u00admands from\nhttp://get\u00adniko\u00adla.\u00adcom/hand\u00adbook.htm\u00adl#al\u00adl-y\u00adou-need-\u00adto-\u00adknow. \n One thing that does\u00adn't tell you is that af\u00adter you init the site, you should\nwalk through  con\u00adf.py  and change the set\u00adtings to your lik\u00ading. \n An\u00adoth\u00ader trick not there is that you can add \n eval \"`nikola tabcompletion`\"\n\n\n\nto your Bash pro\u00adfile to get tab com\u00adple\u00adtion. \n Wordpress import\nIm\u00adport\u00ading from Word\u00adpress is pret\u00adty easy ac\u00adtu\u00adal\u00adly. First you need to go to the\n\u00adWord\u00adpress site dash\u00adboard and go to \"Ex\u00adport\" from the \"Tool\u00ads\" menu. From here\ny\u00adou can down\u00adload an XML file with all your con\u00adtent. Then just do \n nikola import_wordpress export_file.xml\n\n\n\nNote that the cur\u00adrent ver\u00adsion of Niko\u00adla as of this writ\u00ading (6.3.0) does\u00adn't do\nthis right, so you'll need to use the\n git mas\u00adter. There are some is\u00adsues with\u00ad\nthe im\u00adport, since Word\u00adpress has its own markup that it does\u00adn't know ev\u00adery\u00adthing\nabout, so you may need to go in and fix things. Or re\u00adport them as bugs to\nNiko\u00adla and reim\u00adport when they are fixed. \n For com\u00adments, you first need to cre\u00adate a Dis\u00adqus ac\u00adcoun\u00adt, and en\u00adable it in your\n\u00adcon\u00adf.py. You should then up\u00adload the xml file that you ex\u00adport\u00aded from Word\u00adpress\n\u00adto Dis\u00adqus. At this point, the com\u00adments should just work, be\u00adcause Niko\u00adla set\u00ads\nthe Dis\u00adqus url for the im\u00adport\u00aded com\u00adments to the old Word\u00adpress url (look at the\nDis\u00adqus sec\u00adtion of one of the built pages). \n If there's a mis\u00admatch, or if you need to make the urls match your new site for\n\u00adsome rea\u00adson, you can use a url map csv. Niko\u00adla gen\u00ader\u00adates one au\u00adto\u00admat\u00adi\u00adcal\u00adly,\nbut you should make sure that it's cor\u00adrec\u00adt. \n The Dis\u00adqus im\u00adport can take a while to reg\u00adis\u00adter (ac\u00adcord\u00ading to Dis\u00adqus, it can\n\u00adtake up to 24 hours).",
