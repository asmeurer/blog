    <div><p></p><p>So now that Google has <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/accepted-gsoc-students-announced/">announced the results</a> of Google Summer of Code, I want to write down some general things that I noticed when reviewing applications while they are still fresh in my mind.  </p>
<p>Note that none of these things apply to any specific student who applied to SymPy.  Many of these things are things that I noticed that people did right.  </p>
<p>Most of this should apply to any organization, though some of them might be SymPy specific, since that is the lens that I am viewing this through.  These aren't really in any particular order.  </p>
<p></p><ol>
    <li><strong>Fulfill all the requirements.</strong> This is kind of a no brainer, and as it turns out, almost all students who applied to SymPy did indeed do this.  For SymPy, this means that you should submit a patch by the deadline. Other organizations might have other requirements.  If you don't fulfill the requirements, it doesn't matter how good your application is; you won't be eligible and hence won't be accepted.</li>
    <li><strong>Discuss your proposal on the mailing list.</strong> A proposal submitted out of the blue has a poor chance of being accepted.  First, we like to see that you will be involved in the community, and if you don't discuss the proposal at all, it shows badly.  Second, it is very likely that we will not like something about your proposal, or will have questions (see the next point).  If you don't discuss it at all, you are making a shot in the dark.  Even if the proposal is good, it could be rejected simply because it's not something that we feel that we want. And you don't want to accidentally submit a proposal to do something that has already been implemented.  
<p>It's important to discuss it on the public mailing list, not just with a specific mentor.  Even if that mentor is the expert on your project subject and would likely be the person to mentor you if you are accepted, you need to remember that all the mentors review the proposals and decide who to accept.   Also, this year for SymPy, we are trying to put an emphasis on students doing things publicly with the whole community, instead of just with their mentors.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Ask the mentors for advice on your proposal, and then follow it.</strong> Again, most students who applied to SymPy were good on this one too.  We request that all students put their proposals on the GitHub wiki, so that the mentors can take a look at them and give advice.  If you feel uncomfortable putting your application in a public place, send it to some mentors privately.  
<p>But the most important thing here is to actually follow any advice that the mentors give you.  If they tell you that you should expand your timeline section, you should expand your timeline section.  If they tell you you should discuss the implementation more, you should do that (see the next point).  If you don't follow the advice, it looks to the mentor like you didn't listen to him, which doesn't make you appear like a good candidate for acceptance.  Also, the things that they tell you to improve will tend to be the things that they will look at when reviewing your proposal.  </p></li>
    <li><strong>Don't just discuss the theory.</strong> I suspect that this may be more of a problem with SymPy than for other organizations, because SymPy is very math based, so many of the proposals to SymPy involve complex mathematics. One of the biggest issues I saw in proposals was that students discussed the theory of what they wanted to implement too much and not enough of the actual implementation. It's easy to do this, but discussing the implementation is actually more important than the theory of what you want to do.  
<p>An easy way to do this is to give a "fake" example session showing how your code might work after it is completed.  For example, if you were writing a proposal for a PDE solver, you might include something like</p>
<p>[code language="py"]</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; u = Function('u')</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Solve the Heat Equation in one dimension</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; pdesolve(u(x, t).diff(t) - c*<em>2</em>u(x, t).diff(x, x), u(x), {u(x, 0):f(x), u(0, t):0, u(0, pi):0}, method='separation of variables') </p>
<p>2/pi<em>Sum(Integral(f(x)</em>sin(n<em>x), x)</em>sin(n<em>x)</em>exp(-n<strong>2*c</strong>2*t), (n, 1, oo))</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Use Fourier Transforms to get d'Alembert's Solution to the Wave Equation</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; …</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>in your proposal.  Just saying "I plan to implement solvers for PDEs using separation of variables and Fourier Transforms" tells us only what we already know, which is that you can solve PDEs using separation of variables and Fourier Transforms.  What we don't know is how it will look.  The above example shows how the PDE, initial/boundary conditions, and method are entered by the user, and how the output looks.  </p>
<p>A more advanced thing that you can do is to give actual prototype code. This is not required, but it can show that you are dedicated enough to get a start, and can demonstrate how things will work for more complicated projects.</p></li>
    <li><strong>But theory is important too.</strong> This might also be a problem more in SymPy, but maybe not.  The mathematical backgrounds of SymPy developers ranges quite a bit.  For example, I know a lot about the complicated Risch Algorithm for symbolic integration that the majority of people (even among SymPy developers) know hardly anything about, but I know basically nothing about quantum mechanics.  So that more mentors can have a chance to even have a clue about what you are talking about when they are reviewing your proposal, you should try to explain things to a general audience, at least in the introduction of your proposal.  It can also help to explain why your project would be useful, so that even if someone doesn't know what it is, they can see why it would be nice to have.  This doesn't mean that you should sacrifice details by dumbing everything down.  There's a pretty good chance that someone will understand what you are talking about in your specifics, but you should also explain things from the other end.
<p>If you are implementing a specific algorithm, maybe you could give a brief overview of the algorithm.  This will not only explain things to the mentors who might not know how it works, but also it shows that you know how it works too.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Be involved in the community.</strong> We understand that students have classes during the application period, but the more you involve yourself in the community beyond the patch requirement (or whatever requirement some other org might have), the better your chances of being accepted. Every org has to take risks accepting students, because there is always the chance that they will fail.  This is not good for anyone: the student doesn't get paid the full stipend and the organization looses not only the project that would have been implemented, but also the slot that they could have given to someone who wouldn't have failed.  Involving yourself in the community early is the best way to show the community that you are a low risk for failure.</li>
    <li><strong>The proposal is the most important thing.</strong> But don't assume that just because you are involved in the community that you will be accepted.  The most important thing is the proposal.  If you don't have a good proposal, we will not even consider the rest of your activity.  So you should focus most of your energy on writing a high quality proposal.  The quality of the patch and your involvement in the community are secondary considerations after the quality of the proposal.  These might be used to narrow down the list of good proposals to fit the number of slots Google gives us and the number of mentors we have available, but the first phase is always to narrow down the list based on the quality of the proposals.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a consistant nickname, preferably one based on your real name.</strong>  This is something that I think most people do not realize.  If your real name is John Smith, and your IRC nick, GitHub handle, Google Code handle, and GSoC link_id are all jsmith, it makes it very easy for me to associate in my mind: "OK, that person who just submitted that patch is the same person I talked to on IRC last week, and I remember reading his proposal on google-melange.com."  But if your real name is John Smith, your IRC nick is freebird, your GitHub handle is mr.nice, your Google Code handle is smithy, and your link_id on google-melange.com is johnhsmith, I can have a very hard time associating your work in one place with your work in another (my apologies if those are anybodys' real nicknames; I just made them up to make the point here).  Maybe you actually have been very active in the IRC channel, but it is hard for me to realize that based on your nick vs. your real name.  This year for SymPy, we had 25 applications by 25 students.  None of these students were members of the SymPy community a few months ago.  It's very hard for the other mentors and I to keep track of which nicknames associate with which people, and in the end, we may mistakenly believe that you haven't done as much as you really have.  Your best bet is to use one nickname everywhere, and to make it based on your real name, so that we can easily tell who it is even based on the nickname.  If your name is common enough that no one permutation is guaranteed to be available everywhere, at least try to be consistent with your nickname, or just use different permutations of your real name based on what site you are on.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all I can think of for now.  I kind of wish I had thought of two more, so I could make it "Ten pieces of advice," but whatever.  If any SymPy mentors or mentors from other projects feel that something is missing, I would love to hear about it in the comments.</p></div>
