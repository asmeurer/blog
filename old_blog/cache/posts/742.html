<p><html><body><p>Sorry, I get the same error as before (<code>ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (initwrapper_module_0</code>).  I'm trying in the latest <code>autowrap3</code> branch (4496107) (funny how the first part of the SHA1 for your branches always seem to be pure numerical digits).  </p>
<p>Even without it working, one can see the cost of the faster code generated function, which is that it takes a minute or two initially to compile, even for a function as simple as the one in <code>[8]</code></p>
<p>A suggestion: rename <code>quiet=True</code> to <code>verbose=False</code>.</p>
<p>For timeit, IPython's <code>magic_timeit()</code> has its own custom code to automatically determine the number of loops.  So I think the solution is to just take the source for it and modify it to return a value instead of printing it.  Or I noticed that Mateusz started a similar thing <a href="http://github.com/mattpap/sympy-polys/commit/7454fdc4ff4bbff2bfc263c1006b4bed41abb45e">already</a> in his polys11 branch, so maybe I will just work off of that.</p></body></html></p>
