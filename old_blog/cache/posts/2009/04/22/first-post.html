<p><html><body><p>Well, I got accepted into the Google Summer of Code program for 2009. I will be working on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/">SymPy</a>, a computer algebra system written and run in Python. I will be working on building an ordinary differential equation engine for it, as its present capabilities are very limited. You can look at my application <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/portland_state/t124024247418">abstract</a>. SymPy requires that I blog about my work at least once a week, so here it is. More will be posted here later.
</p><div>Originally I started this blog on <a href="http://asmeurersympy.blogspot.com/2009/04/first-post.html">blogger</a>, but I think WordPress will be a little better.  <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Namely, it seems to support </span><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-latex/"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">plugins</span></a><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">, so I can insert LaTeX code much easier.</span> It would seem that only blogs not hosted at wordpress.com support plugins.</div></p>
<div>So I think I will  just use <a href="http://ktd.club.fr/programmation/latexit_en.php">LaTeXiT</a> and do it manually.  Oh well.  Anyway, here is the Divergence Theorem, which nicely shows both mathematical beauty and LaTeX beauty.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15" title="divergence-theorem" src="http://asmeurersympy.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/divergence-theorem.png" alt="divergence-theorem" width="455" height="105"></a></div>
