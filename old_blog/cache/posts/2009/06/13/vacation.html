<p><html><body><p>I am on vacation now.  I am visiting the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, Yellowstone, and other places.  I will be able to do some coding on the road, but not as much as when I am home.  The vacation will last about a week.  Hopefully I will be able to get a blog post about what I have been doing in SymPy written up in the next few days. </p></body></html></p>
