<p><html><body><p>So I pushed some changes to github so Ondrej could help me debug the nseries tests, when I noticed that the changes that I pushed had some bad comments.  So I decided to rebase.  But git rebase -i told me that there was already a rebase in progress.  I figured that I must have done it a long time ago and forgot to abort, so I ran git rebase --abort.  </p>
<p>DON'T DO THAT.</p>
<p>I noticed my editor was telling me that an open file had changed.  Then, I noticed that ALL of my uncommited changes were gone!  And, being uncommited changes, git did not have them saved anywhere!</p>
<p>So now I started to panic.  I had done a lot of work on dsolve that I hadn't commited yet. Normally, I have hourly backups run by <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">Time Machine</a>, but I am on vacation and my backup drive is at home.  So I started to see if I could retrieve it somewhere.  grep quickly told me that it wasn't in the hidden git directory, but it was still in my .pyc files.  But a Google search told me that retrieving from that is not so easy, if not impossible with Python 2.6.  So then, I decided to see if there was any lingering stuff in my virtual memory from my editor.  So I ran grep on my harddrive and waited.  </p>
<p>While I was waiting, though, I noticed when I scrolled up in my command history that my lost changes were in my Terminal.  It turns out that I had just run git commit --interactive and had used * on my patches, so it gave me everything!  </p>
<p>So I copied my Terminal history and will work on putting everything back tomorrow.  It should be easy, assuming that git apply works for the format that git gives in commit --interactive.  </p>
<p>So the lessons are: Don't abort a rebase without commiting.  Don't start a rebase and then leave it there.  Look in your Terminal history if you loose stuff.  And it might be a good idea to make manual backups if you are away from your backup drive for a while.</p>
<p>This also highlights why it is important to try to recover data immediately after realizing that it is gone.  If I had closed my Terminal session or filled it past the maximum number of lines, my data would be gone.  Even if it were in my virtual memory, that wouldn't last forever either.  </p></body></html></p>
