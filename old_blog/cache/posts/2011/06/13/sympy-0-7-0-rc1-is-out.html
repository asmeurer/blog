<p><html><body><p>My blog post is a little late this week because I wanted to be able to announce this.  I have released the first release candidate for SymPy 0.7.0 (see <a href="https://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/update-for-the-beginning-of-the-summer/" target="_blank">this previous blog post</a> for a little bit of what's new since the last release).  You can download source (Linux/Mac OS X version) <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/downloads/detail?name=sympy-0.7.0.rc1.tar.gz" target="_blank">here</a> and the Windows installer <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/downloads/detail?name=sympy-0.7.0.rc1.win32.exe" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please download it at test it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I discovered soon after releasing it that the code does not work in Python 2.4 or 2.5.  I will soon release SymPy 0.7.0.rc2 to fix this. Please test it in Python 2.6 and 2.7 until then, or test the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/tree/0.7.0" target="_blank">0.7.0 branch</a> of the official SymPy repository.</p>
<p>If everything goes smoothly, then the full release should be out in a week or so.  Watch this blog or the <a href="http://sympy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">official SymPy blog</a> for the announcement.</p></body></html></p>
