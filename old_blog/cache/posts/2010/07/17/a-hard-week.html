<p><html><body><p>After last week's <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/integration-of-exponential-functions/">breakthrough</a>, work this week has been very slow.  I started working on the Parametric Risch Differential Equation Problem, which is almost identical to the Risch Differential Equation Problem in how it is solved, except there are a few extra steps.  Unfortunately, because it is so similar, Bronstein breezes through the description.  This is fine for the parts that are the same, but he is a little unclear on how some of the new parts fit in.  Also, his pseudocode has a line more or less saying </p>
<p>[code]</p>
<p>if r1 = … = rn = 0 then
    N = -1
else
    N = max(deg(r1), …, deg(rn))</p>
<p>for i from 0 to N
    for j from 1 to m
        Mij = coefficient(rj, t^i)</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>where M is a matrix.  It is not very clear what this is supposed to mean in the case where N = -1.  Obviously, you can't have a a matrix with negative dimensions.  Clearly, this means that this particular function doesn't apply somehow in this case, but I am not really even sure where it fits in to the whole algorithm at this point in reading.  After reading a few more pages in, it gives a few hints here and there on how it is to be used, but never is it explicitly shown, in pseudocode or otherwise.  So for now, I think my best bet is to read ahead and get a fuller understanding of the complete function before I try implementing anything (this is what I had been doing before, but I caught up to myself).  </p>
<p>Also, on an unrelated note, I just found out today that I passed my <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/faqs#evaluations">Google Summer of Code midterm evaluation</a>.  This means that I will receive half of my stipend for the program (the other half comes after passing the final evaluation at the end of the summer), and that I can continue working on my project in the program.  </p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Later in the text, it runs through an example and says "… $latex dc = -1$, hence M and A are 0 by 0 matrices."  So obviously, that is what was meant.  </p></body></html></p>
