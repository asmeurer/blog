<html><body><p>So I was browsing the <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/">Google Open Source Blog</a>, when I found a link to this <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn//gitmagic/">Git Tutorial</a>.  I wish I had found this a month ago when I started learning Git.  SymPy only has a very basic tutorial for Git.  Their main tutorial is still written for Mercurial, which they used until recently.


Anyway, I have been reading the tutorial, and so far it is awesome, so I thought it would make a good post here.</p></body></html>
