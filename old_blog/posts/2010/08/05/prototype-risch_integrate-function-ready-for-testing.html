    <div><p></p><p>So today I finally finished up the prototype function I talked about <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/07/31/integration-of-primitive-functions/">last week</a>.  The function is called <code>risch_integrate()</code> and is available at my <a href="http://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/tree/integration3">integration3</a> branch.  Unlike the inner level functions I have showcased in <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/07/31/integration-of-primitive-functions/">previous</a> <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/integration-of-exponential-functions/">blog posts</a>, this function does not require you to do substitution for dummy variables and manually create a list of derivatives, etc.  All you have to do is pass it a function and the integration variable, and it will return the result, just like normal <code>integrate()</code>. I have spent the past few days working on a monster of a function called <code>build_extension()</code> that does this preparsing work for you.  The reason that the function was so hard to write is that the transcendental Risch Algorithm is very picky.  <em>Every</em> differential extension has to be transcendental over the previous extensions.  This means that if you have a function like $latex e^x + e^{\frac{x}{2}}$, you cannot write this as $latex t_0 + t_1$ with $latex t_0=e^x$ and $latex t_1=e^{\frac{x}{2}}$ because $latex t_0$ and $latex t_1$ will each be algebraic over the other ($latex t_0=t_1^2$).  You also cannot let $latex t_0=e^{x}$ and rewrite the whole integral in terms of $latex t_0$ because you will get $latex t_0 + \sqrt{t_0}$, which is an algebraic function.  The only way that you can do it is to let $latex t_0=e^{\frac{x}{2}}$, and then your function will be $latex t_0^2 + t_0$.  </p>
<p>Now, fortunately, there is an algorithm that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for determining if an extension is algebraic over the previous ones.  It's called the Risch Structure Theorems.  My first order of business this week was to finish implementing these.  This is actually the reason that I we had to wait until now to get this prototype function.  The Structure Theorems are at the very end of Bronstein's book, and the integration algorithm is not correct without them (namely, it is not correct if you add an algebraic extension).  I just recently got to them in my reading.  Actually, I skipped some work on tangent integration so I could get to them first.  I hope to talk a little about them in a future "Risch Integration" blog post, though be aware that they require some extremely intense algebraic machinery to prove, so I won't be giving any proofs.</p>
<p>Even though these algorithms can tell me, for example, that I shouldn't have added $latex t_0=e^x$ above because it makes $latex e^{\frac{x}{2}}=\sqrt{t_0}$, that means that I have to go back and restart my search for an extension so that I can try to get $latex t_0=e^{\frac{x}{2}}$ instead.  So I wrote a simple function that takes the arguments of the exponentials and determines the lowest common factor.  This heuristic saves a lot of time.  </p>
<p>I also noticed (actually, Chris Smith inadvertently pointed it out to me; super thanks to him), that the Structure Theorem algorithms only tell you if the terms are the same as monomials.  It would tell you that $latex e^x = e^{x + 1}$ because both satisfy $latex Dt=t$.  Therefore, I had to also modify the structure theorem algorithms to pull out any constant term.  </p>
<p>It can still be necessary to restart building the extension even with the above heuristic.  For example, if you have $latex e^x + e^{x^2} + e^{\frac{x}{2} + x^2}$, and start with $latex t_0=e^x$ and $latex t_1=e^{x^2}$, then the structure theorems will tell you that $latex e^{x/2 + x^2} = \sqrt{t_0}t_1$, which we cannot use because of the radical.  The solution it uses is to split it up as $latex e^x + e^{x^2} + e^{\frac{x}{2}}e^{x^2}$ (the structure theorems tell you exactly how to do this so you are splitting in terms of the other exponentials) and then restart the extension building entirely.  This can be an expensive operation, because you have to rebuild $latex t_0$ and $latex t_1$, but this time, the heuristic function I wrote from above handles the $latex e^{\frac{x}{2}}$ correctly, making $latex t_0=e^{\frac{x}{2}}$, with the final answer $latex t_0^2 + t_1 + t_0t_1$.  I could have probably made it smarter by only going back to before the conflicting extensions, but this was quite a bit more work, and adds more difficulties such as non-trivial relationships, so I just took the lazy way and restarted completely.  It doesn't take <em>that</em> much time.  </p>
<p>Of course, sometimes, you cannot add a new exponential, no matter how you add the extensions.  The classic example is $latex e^{\frac{\log{(x)}}{2}}$, which you can see is actually equal to $latex \sqrt{x}$, an algebraic function.  Therefore, I had to implement some tricky logic to keep the <code>build_extension()</code> function from trying again infinitely.  I hope I did it right, so that it never infinite loops, and never fails when it really can be done.  Only time and testing will tell.</p>
<p>It is exactly the same for logarithms, except in that case, when a new logarithm is algebraic in terms of old ones, it can be written as a linear combination of them.  This means that there are never any radicals to worry about, though you do also have to worry about constants.  For example, $latex \log{(x)}$ looks the same as $latex \log{(2x)}$ because they both satisfy $latex Dt=\frac{1}{x}$.  An example of a logarithm that is algebraic over old ones is $latex \log{(x^2 - 1)}$ over $latex \log{(x + 1)}$ and $latex \log{(x - 1)}$, because $latex \log{(x^2 - 1)}=\log{((x + 1)(x - 1))}=\log{(x + 1)} + \log{(x - 1)}$.  </p>
<p>The parallels between exponentials and logarithms are amazing.  For the structure theorems, the exponential case is exactly the same as the logarithmic case except replacing addition with multiplication and multiplication with exponentiation.  For the exponential case, you need the arguments of the already added logarithms to find the algebraic dependence, and the arguments of the already added exponentials to find the constant term.  For the logarithmic case, you need the arguments of the already added exponentials to find the algebraic dependence, and the arguments of the already added logarithms to find the content term. Everything else is exactly the same, except for the shift in operators.  Of course, I realize why these things are, mathematically, but the symmetry still amazing to me.  I will hopefully explain in more detail in my future Structure Theorems post.  </p>
<p>So onto the <code>risch_integrate()</code> function.  Here is the text that I have basically put in my <a href="http://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/commit/e3cd5f18f86fd6377836f33f726182c8bd4dc1a0">commit message</a>, the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?q=2010">aptly numbered issue</a> that I have created for it, and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sympy/browse_thread/thread/2464fa764f6f47aa">post to the mailing list</a> (it's not so much that I am lazy as that I was really excited to get this out there).</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
<p>I have ready in my integration3 branch a prototype risch_integrate() function that is a user-level function for the full Risch Algorithm I have been implementing this summer.  Pull from h<a href="//github.com/asmeurer/sympy/tree/integration3">ttp://github.com/asmeurer/sympy/tree/integration3</a>.</p>
<p>This is NOT ready to go in.  It is a prototype function that I am making available so people can try out the new algorithm and hopefully help me to find the bugs in it.  Please pass it your favorite non-elementary integrals and see if it can determine that they are not elementary.  If you try to pass it a very crazy function at random, the chances are pretty high that it will not be elementary.  So a better way to test it is to come up with a crazy function, then differentiate it. Then pass the derivative and see if it can give you your original function back.  Note that it will probably not look exactly the same as your original function, and may differ by a constant.  You should verify by differentiating the result you get and calling cancel() (or simplify(), but usually cancel() is enough) on the difference.</p>
<p>So you can review the code too, if you like, but just know that things are not stable yet, and this isn't strictly a branch for review.  </p>
<p>So far, this function only supports exponentials and logarithms.</p>
<p>Support for trigonometric functions is planned.  Algebraic functions are</p>
<p>not supported. If the function returns an unevaluated Integral, it means</p>
<p>that it has proven the integral to be non-elementary.  Note that several</p>
<p>cases are still not implemented, so you may get NotImplementedError</p>
<p>instead. Eventually, these will all be eliminated, and the only</p>
<p>NotImplementedError you should see from this function is</p>
<p>NotImplementedError("Algebraic extensions are not supported.")</p>
<p>This function has not been integrated in any way with the already</p>
<p>existing integrate() yet, and you can use it to compare.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>[code language="py"]</p>
<p>In [1]: risch_integrate(exp(x**2), x)</p>
<p>Out[1]:</p>

<p>⎮  ⎝x ⎠</p>
<p>⎮ ℯ     dx</p>

<p>In [3]: %timeit risch_integrate(x*<em>100</em>exp(x), x).diff(x)</p>
<p>1 loops, best of 3: 270 ms per loop</p>
<p>In [4]: integrate(x*<em>100</em>exp(x), x)</p>
<p>... hangs ...</p>
<p>In [5]: risch_integrate(x/log(x), x)</p>
<p>Out[5]:</p>
<p>⌠</p>
<p>⎮   x</p>
<p>⎮ ────── dx</p>
<p>⎮ log(x)</p>
<p>⌡</p>
<p>In [6]: risch_integrate(log(x)**10, x).diff(x)</p>
<p>Out[6]:
   10
log  (x)</p>
<p>In [7]: integrate(log(x)**10, x).diff(x)</p>
<p>Out[7]:
   10
log  (x)</p>
<p>In [8]: %timeit risch_integrate(log(x)**10, x).diff(x)</p>
<p>10 loops, best of 3: 159 ms per loop</p>
<p>In [9]: %timeit integrate(log(x)**10, x).diff(x)</p>
<p>1 loops, best of 3: 2.35 s per loop</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>Be warned that things are still very buggy and you should always verify</p>
<p>results by differentiating.  Usually, cancel(diff(result, x) - result)</p>
<p>should be enough.  This should go to 0.</p>
<p>So please, please, PLEASE, try out this function and report any bugs that you find.  It is not necessary to report NotImplementedError bugs, because I already know about those (I put them in there), and as I mentioned above, they are all planned to disappear.  Also, I am continually updating my branch with fixes, so you should do a "git pull" and try again before you report anything.</p>
<p>Also, I am aware that there are test failures.  This is because I had to hack exp._eval_subs() to only do exact substitution (no algebraic substitution).  It's just a quick hack workaround, and I should eventually get a real fix.  </p>
<p>Finally, I'm thinking there needs to be a way to differentiate between an unevaluated Integral because the integrator failed and an unevaluated Integral because it has proven the integral to be non-elementary.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>Also, looking at the integral from the previous blog post, you can get the different results by using the <code>handle_log</code> argument to <code>risch_integrate()</code>:</p>
<p>If <code>handle_first == 'log'</code> (the default right now), then it will gather all logarithms first, and then exponentials (insomuch as it can do it in that order).  If <code>handle_first='exp'</code>, it gathers exponentials first.  The difference is that the Risch Algorithm integrates recursively, one extension at a time, starting with the outer-most one. So if you have an expression with both logarithms and exponentials, such that they do not depend on each other, <code>handle_first == 'log'</code> will integrate the exponentials first, because they will be gathered last (be at the top of the tower of extensions), and <code>handle_first == 'exp'</code> will integrate the logarithms first.  Right now, I have defaulted to 'log' because the exponential integration algorithm is slightly more complete.  If you get <code>NotImplementedError</code> with one, it is possible (though I don't know for sure yet) that you might get an answer with the other.  </p>
<p>Also, they can give different looking results, and at different speeds.  For example:</p>
<p><strong>Hover over the code and click on the left-most, "view source" icon (a paper icon with <tt>&lt; &gt;</tt> over it) to view without breaks.  Opens in a new window.</strong></p>
