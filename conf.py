#
# If you want to use Nikola with a non-supported language you have to provide
# a module containing the necessary translations
# (cf. the modules at nikola/data/themes/base/messages/fr.py).
# If a specific post is not translated to a language, then the version
# in the default language will be shown instead.

# What is the default language?
DEFAULT_LANG = "en"

# What other languages do you have?
# The format is {"translationcode" : "path/to/translation" }
# the path will be used as a prefix for the generated pages location
TRANSLATIONS = {
    DEFAULT_LANG: "",
    # Example for another language:
    # "es": "./es",
}

# What will translated input files be named like?

# If you have a page something.rst, then something.rst.pl will be considered
# its Polish translation.
#     (in the above example: path == "something", lang == "pl", ext == "rst")
# this pattern is also used for metadata:
#     something.meta -> something.meta.pl

TRANSLATIONS_PATTERN = "{path}.{ext}.{lang}"

# If you don't want your Polish files to be considered Perl code, use this:
# TRANSLATIONS_PATTERN = "{path}.{lang}.{ext}"
#     Note that this pattern will become the default in v7.0.0.

# Links for the sidebar / navigation bar.
# You should provide a key-value pair for each used language.
NAVIGATION_LINKS = {
    DEFAULT_LANG: (
        ('/archive.html', 'Archives'),

        ('/about', "About"),
    ),

# Below this point, everything is optional

# While nikola can select a sensible locale for each language,
# sometimes explicit control can come handy.
# In this file we express locales in the string form that
# python's locales will accept in your OS, by example
# "en_US.utf8" in unix-like OS, "English_United States" in Windows.
# LOCALES = dict mapping language --> explicit locale for the languages
# in TRANSLATIONS. You can ommit one or more keys.
# LOCALE_FALLBACK = locale to use when an explicit locale is unavailable
# LOCALE_DEFAULT = locale to use for languages not mentioned in LOCALES; if
# not set the default Nikola mapping is used.

# POSTS and PAGES contains (wildcard, destination, template) tuples.
#
# The wildcard is used to generate a list of reSt source files
# (whatever/thing.txt).
#
# That fragment could have an associated metadata file (whatever/thing.meta),
# and optionally translated files (example for spanish, with code "es"):
#     whatever/thing.txt.es and whatever/thing.meta.es
#
#     This assumes you use the default TRANSLATIONS_PATTERN.
#
# From those files, a set of HTML fragment files will be generated:
# cache/whatever/thing.html (and maybe cache/whatever/thing.html.es)
#
# These files are combinated with the template to produce rendered
# pages, which will be placed at
# output / TRANSLATIONS[lang] / destination / pagename.html
#
# where "pagename" is the "slug" specified in the metadata file.
#
# The difference between POSTS and PAGES is that POSTS are added
# to feeds and are considered part of a blog, while PAGES are
# just independent HTML pages.
